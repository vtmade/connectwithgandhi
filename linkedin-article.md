## The Challenge

How do you explore 45,458 documents spanning 80 years of Mahatma Gandhi's life without getting lost? His complete works—letters, speeches, articles, and philosophical writings from 1869 to 1948—shaped movements and changed history. But traditional archives are linear and overwhelming. You need to know what you're looking for before you start.

I wanted something different: **a way to wander through Gandhi's mind and discover unexpected connections.**

## Why This Visualization Transforms Learning

**Serendipitous Discovery**
Instead of searching keywords, explore naturally. Click "Satyagraha" and dive into South African correspondence. Navigate to "Economic Thought" and discover his vision for village industries. The interactive tree mimics how we actually learn—through curiosity and connection.

**Temporal Context**
Organized across 10 chronological life periods, you see not just *what* Gandhi said, but *when* and *why*. Watch his philosophy evolve from lawyer to activist to elder statesman.

**Making the Overwhelming Manageable**
The multi-level hierarchy breaks 45,458 documents into walkable paths. Start broad with "Political Thought," then drill down to specific speeches. Each level reveals more depth while keeping you oriented.

**Visual Memory**
By transforming text into an interactive tree, you're building a spatial mental map of Gandhi's intellectual landscape—and our brains remember that.

## How I Built This

**The Challenge:** 103MB of data—too large for browsers. Python scripts parsed all documents, extracted metadata, and built hierarchical structures using thematic keyword algorithms while preserving chronological organization.

**The Magic:** D3.js creates a collapsible tree where each node reveals progressive detail. I fine-tuned animations for smooth, intuitive exploration.

**The Infrastructure:** GitHub Releases serves the dataset; Netlify hosts the visualization. Fast, global, zero cost.

**The Accelerator:** Built entirely with **Claude Code**—Anthropic's AI development assistant. Architecture, debugging, optimization—all collaborative. What could have taken weeks took days.

**Tech Stack:** Claude Code • D3.js • Python • Netlify • GitHub Releases

## Impact & Future

This creates new possibilities for engaging historical archives:
- **Students** explore topically without sifting through volumes
- **Researchers** quickly identify relevant documents within periods
- **Educators** guide learners through curated discovery paths
- **Anyone** experiences Gandhi's breadth in an afternoon

The pattern is replicable—imagine this for other historical figures, literary archives, legal documents, or scientific papers.
