      "fullContent": "DEAR MAHATMAJI, I congratulate you upon your dissociation with the believers of violence as far as possible. God gave you an opportunity to do so at Poona, but at Bombay you forgot all about that God-given opportunity. At Bardoli God gave you that opportunity again. I am exceedingly glad that you did not make the same mistake at Wardha as you had done at Bombay. . . . . . . Violence was created by God who gave it a limited life. God in His infinite wisdom now finds that violence was given a trial and found wanting in preserving world peace. . . . This world war may not be the longest but it must be the last, and a new world with perfect peace and tranquillity will emerge out of the ashes of violence and armament for the benefit of mankind. . . . God-believing India will not have man-given violence and armament- controlled freedom for exploiting the weaker section of humanity. She must have God-given freedom for their service—seva. God-given freedom can be obtained only by satyagraha, sufferings for which can be successfully undertaken only by those whose surrender to Him is complete. The number of satyagrahis is steadily increasing. Let the advocates of violence say and do whatever they may, the number of believers in non- violence will steadily go on increasing and the world will have real peace. HARA DAYAL NAG Chandpur, 24-1-1942 Though the foregoing{1} has an intrinsic value as an expression of robust faith, it is printed as being from the pen of the oldest living Congressman who clings to non-violence as an infant to its mother’s breast.

At the moment it seems to me that the period of the tour will end in Utkal. I got the annual report which you had sent. You did right in paying the revenue. Can’t you think of some way of proceeding against Sitaram? It is not necessary to put up with his tyranny. You need not go to a court of law immediately. For the present, it will be enough to make a complaint to the local officer. Ba will soon be released. She has maintained good health. The box of khadi which you gave is still lying in Wardha. Krishnadas is trying to sell a few things from it. Blessings from BAPU",

Somebody should carry her and walk in the sunshine. The head should be kept covered. This will warm up the skin and make it less sensitive. I believe the cold will then disappear. Once you have formed the habit of keeping accounts, you don’t find it a burden to do so and discover through experience the very great value of the practice. Whether or not one’s life is peaceful should make no difference in this matter. There are some things which we should try hard and learn to do with a peaceful mind even in the midst of highly distracting circumstances. Write to me regularly once a week. Blessings from BAPU",

This is a problem which can be solved only with patience You need not get alarmed and run away. It should be enough that you yourself do not eat either meat or beef. But you cannot prevent others from doing so. It would be good if they thought about it and stopped on their own. I would, therefore, advise you to have patience and go on doing the work I have suggested. I do not want to keep you too long. But I shall be satisfied if you start writing up the accounts and set them in order and bring the sanitation work within manageable limits. The other changes can be introduced only after my return. Jehangirji must have arrived there by now. Kanchan remains engrossed in work. She has not recovered complete strength, but I am hopeful that she will.

If you get your hair cropped, you would save the time you have to in taking proper care of it, save expense over oil, comb, etc., and get rid of the false notion that there is beauty in hair. Without hair, the head remains clean. For a woman, absence of hair is a sign that she is observing brahmacharya. If girls and grown-up women get their hair cropped, the practice would cease to be regarded as sign of widowhood. If we think about the mater we may discover some other benefits also.

There is a free Sanskrit class conducted in Kalbadevi Road{1} by Narahari Shastri. It should be easier for you to go to some one to teach you Hindi. If you will go to the untouchable quarters in Madugaum, you will have no difficulty in knowing untouchables from touchables. There is in Matunga{2} a school conducted for untouchables. You can devote some time to that school if you choose to do so. And where you cannot do any personal work for them, and if you have even a few pice to spare, you may set aside that amount and give to those who are working for the so-called untouchables.

      "fullContent": "BETTIAH, August 13, 1917 DEAR MR. SLY, I have thought, slept, prayed and read 1 Cor. XIII which latter I always do before coming to the committee meetings. I have discussed the question with my friends too. I was surprised to find in Babu Brajkishore the strongest supporter of Mr. Rainy’s energetic defence of the fairness of the enhancement so far as it is measured by the outturn. All the others resisted him. Babu Brajkishore to my astonishment held his ground and said that on the score of lowness of rent he was entirely at one with Mr. Sweeney’s finding. His argument however is totally unconvincing. But all my friends held that I would sell the raiyats’ cause, if I agreed to the planters’ proposition. They unanimously appreciated the fact that the planters who are so strong in every way had at all accepted the idea of a reduction of sharahbeshi. The majority of them would have me to buy peace from the committee even though it may mean a big sacrifice. I thought that I ought to mention these pleasing incidents. They augur well for the future. My friends who represent, as I hold, the culture of Bihar are not fanatics as planter-friends have so often urged. There is no greater fanatic among us than myself. Now for my offer which is absolutely final. My last state was to accept the Raja Saheb’s proposition{1}. That reduced to percentage represents a reduction of 55 per cent as against the planters’ 25 per cent. And if I am to write a dissenting minute, I should write in defence of that offer with the clearest conscience. For the sake of securing unanimity among ourselves, I am prepared to accept a reduction of 40 per cent only, i.e., 15 per cent more than the planters’ offer. For me this borders, in my language, upon the penal. Under the planters’ offer, they get Re. 0-6-7 per rupee, under mine Re. 0-5-3 per rupee. My final offer therefore covers all possibilities, the possibility even of Mr. Whitty’s{2} appeal succeeding. My own original offer was a rise of Re. 0-3-0 in the rupee. That is equivalent to a reduction of 66 per cent. My present offer represents a reduction of 40 per cent. I have therefore put up 26 per cent. If then pressure is now to be applied, it must be not to me but to the planters. Mr. Irwin has without the slightest justification taken large sums in tawan and has collected sharahbeshi for the past 6 years. He can have little to grumble about if he accepts my offer. For both Turkaulia and Peeprah, there is evidence before the committee of sufficient pressure exerted upon the raiyats to vitiate sharahbeshi. We have it on record that Mr. Sweeney in coming to his decision on coercion had not read the judgment in Lomraj Singh’s case nor had he the full Bench decision before him on undue influence. It is settled law now that there is no distinction between undue influence and coercion. I just mention these facts to show that we as a committee dare not ignore them. It is not possible to base our decision merely on the theoretical ground of the so-called lowness of rent. I am sure the committee will think a hundred times before putting on the Government the strain of arbitrating upon a figure dispute between its members. I have gone to the furthest limit in order to avoid any such calamity. If you and the other members cannot find it in your conscience to accept my approach, I shall sorrowfully write my minute of dissent but it will be, as I have said, in support of 55 per cent reduction. 40 per cent reduction is for the consideration of the members (and the planters only, if, in your opinion, they should be consulted again). Yours sincerely, M. K. GANDHI I have omitted decimals in my figures. M. K.

      "fullContent": "Rao Bahadur Rajah has rendered public service by publishing the correspondence between himself and Dr. Moonje.{1} There was no breach of confidence in the publication. Privilege of confidence is surely not available for proposals which the receiver may regard to be dangerous or harmful to a cause as the Moonje-Ambedkar proposal most undoubtedly is. That neither Dr. Moonje nor Dr. Ambedkar regards his proposal as dangerous does not make it less so in the estimation of those who disapprove of it. What else was R.B. Rajah todo if he intended by all legitimate means to thwart it? He entered into correspondence with some of those who were parties to the Yeravda Pact, and when he saw that not one of them favoured the proposal he promptly released the correspondence for publication. One may hope that we have seen the last of any bargaining between. Dr. Ambedkar and savarna Hindus for the transfer to another form of several million dumb Harijans as if they were chattels. The Pact is between one large section of Hindus and another. It frustrated the attempt to cut the Hindu body into two and gave the opportunity to savarna Hindus to make reparation to those millions whom they had ill-treated for centuries. Dr. Ambedkar wants to scourge the savarna Hindus as he has every right to do, but he may not expect the latter to be party to it. He has every right to be impatient. But prejudices and superstitions centuries old do not die in a moment. No one who has at all cared to study the reform movement will deny that every attempt humanly possible has been and is being made to bring home to the savarna Hindus the message of the anti-untouchability movement. If Dr. Ambedkar’s proposal were accepted, the reform movement would receive a setback which might mean death to it in the end. For it contemplates a paper but legal transfer of Harijans from the Hindu fold to some other, no matter by what name the latter is called. It must mean fratricide. Harijans themselves will be cut up into two rival sections, and if they are both classified as Harijans within the meaning of the Pact their state then will be worse than it is today, and it will be an evil day for unhappy India if such a calamity descends on her. It is futile to argue that although there will be nominal change of religion, there won’t be a real one, and if there is any, it would not be so bad as if Harijans were called Christians or Muslims. If it is a change of religion, it matters little under what label they are classified. Only if they are said to belong to another religion and still remain Harijans, an additional cause of internecine quarrel would be created; and all this to satisfy the desire to punish savarna Hindus. If in his anger or impatience Dr. Ambedkar refuses to see the obvious result, surely Dr. Moonje ought to. And who are we, the self-constituted leaders, to barter away the religious freedom of Harijans? Has not every Harijan, however dull or stupid he may be, the right to make his own choice? It is one thing for Dr. Ambedkar and those who wish to change over to some other religion to do so, and wholly another for political or other parties to assume such change for the mass of Harijans and to base thereon legal and other consequences of a farreaching character. If the leaders of different religions in India ceased to compete with one another for enticing Harijans into their fold, it would be well for this unfortunate country. I have the profound conviction that those who are engaged in the competition are not serving the cause of religion. By looking at it in terms of politics or economics they reduce the religious values, whereas the proper thing would be to esitmate politics and every other thing in terms of religion. Religion deals with the science of the soul. Great as the other forces of the world are, if there is such a thing as God soul force is the greatest of all. We know as a matter of fact that the greater the force the finer it is. Hitherto electricity has held the field among the finer physical powers. And yet nobody has seen it except through its wonderful results. Scientific speculation dares to talk of a force finer even than that of electricity. But no instrument devised by man has been able to know anything positive of soul force or spiritual force. It is on that force that the true religious reformer has hitherto relied and never without hope fulfilled. It is that force which will finally govern the welfare of Harijans and everyone else and confound the calculations of men however gifted they may be intellectually. The reformer who has entered upon the duty of ridding Hinduism of the disease of untouchability has to depend in everything he does on that force and nothing else.",

      "fullContent": "Thus writes Dr. Rajan{1} to Mahadev Desai: The other day when I was at Segaon to see Mahatmaji, I found him observing silence. You know he wrote on a slip of paper to the following effect, referring to his silence: “This has become a health-necessity with me”. These few words have made me ponder over the idea of silence in relation to physical health. As a piece of scientific information it will be good to have a record of his personal experience. I should like to know as a result of his observing silence, 1. whether there is any visible drop in the blood-pressure variation; 2. whether after a period of silence he feels physically better and is able to put forth greater energy and application to his work; and 3. whether he feels mental recuperation also pari passu with that of his body while he is observing silence. To observe silence is indeed a difficult self-imposed restriction. But it is worth while in the interests of physical and mental well-being to make this possible.{2} You know that I never write or indulge in such speculative writing to a busy person like Gandhiji. You will therefore appreciate as to why I am writing to you. If you think the information which I seek is worth while, I shall be glad if you can publish it in Harijan. Before I answer the questions let me say that for me silence is no strain and no effort. Indeed I am so tired of arguing and talking that I speak only when I feel I must. Generally, therefore, I am nowadays silent except to visitors who come by appointment and on some business connected with activities with which I am identified. In the Segaon Ashram I am silent to everybody except in cases of sickness and the like. I observe too that I get easily irritated if members of the Ashram act in a manner contrary to expectation. I find that silence avoids irritation. Now for the questions. 1. There is a perceptible drop in blood-pressure when I observe silence. Medical friends have therefore advised me to take as much silence as I can. 2. There is no doubt whatsoever that after every silence I feel recuperated and have greater energy for work. The output of work during silence is much greater than when I am not silent. 3. The mind enjoys a peace during silence which it does not without it. That is to say, the decision to be silent itself produces a soothing effect on me. It lifts a burden off my mind. My experience tells me that silence soothes the nerves in a manner no drugs can. With me it also induces sleep. Caution : I have noticed in the jails that prisoners get moody when, deprived of company, they have to observe enforced silence. To produce the effect I have described, silence has to be liked. No one, therefore, need be silent out of love of imitation or merely for the knowledge that it produces on me the effect described by me. The best thing would be to take silence on medical advice. Needless to say that here I do not refer to the spiritual need and effects of silence. SEGAON, October 22, 1939",

      "fullContent": "Wednesday NEW BILL At last the new Bill{1} has been published. There is no time to give a translation. It is not even possible just yet to comment on it at length. But I see that it will have the following consequences: (1) Act No. 2 will be repealed, save in so far as it protects the rights of Asiatic minors. (2) The other registration Act will not be repealed. (3) Anyone who can write fifty words in a language selected by an officer will be allowed to enter. Indian languages are included in this, but that does not mean that Indians will be able to enter in large numbers. (4) The wives and minor children of domiciled Indians do not seem to be protected. (5) The rights of old residents of the Cape and Natal are seriously endangered. (6) The granting of domicile certificates to Indians mentioned in (5) above will be at the discretion of the authorities. (7) There seems to be no provision for a right of appeal to a court by anyone who may be wrongly prohibited. This seems to be the position. It appears from General Smuts’ speech{2} that Indians will enjoy only the rights which they possess at present in their respective provinces, and that only a limited number of fresh immigrants will be permitted every year. If the Bill permits educated Indians to come in as fresh immigrants without requiring them to register, it will enable the satyagraha campaign to be withdrawn. Whether or not the Bill bears any such meaning, it is not possible as yet to say with certainty. But what will be the position of Natal and the Cape? It is serious enough to call for a bit of thinking. If the Bill passes into law, educated persons will not be able to come in as freely as they have been doing, and the rights of those who are already there will not be protected. Natal and the Cape need to take immediate steps. I think they should first correspond with General Smuts and then petition{3} the Assembly. This is a critical time. The Bill does not yet appear to have received publicity.{4} The summary{5} given above, however, is based on the published text of the Bill.",

      "fullContent": "2 {1} FRIENDS, We are all so preoccupied with other affairs that the events in Malabar hardly attract the attention they deserve. The ending of the trouble has become a matter of great urgency. It is one of simple humanity. Be the Moplahs ever so bad, they deserve to be treated as human beings. Their wives and children demand our sympathy. Nor are they all bad. And yet there can be no doubt that many innocent men must have beep adjudged guilty. Forcible conversions are horrible things. But Moplah bravery must command admiration. These Malabaris are not fighting for the love of it. They are fighting for what they consider is their Religion and in the manner they consider is religious. The vast majority of them have nothing personal to gain by continuing their resistance. Their sin is not of deliberation, but ignorance. If we permit the extermination of Such a brave people, it will be remembered against us and will be accounted as Indian cowar- dice. I make bold to say that had Mr. Yakub Hasan been allowed to go to Malabar, had I not been warned against entering Malabar, had Mussulmans of real influence been invited to go, this long drawn out agony could have been avoided. But it is not yet too late. The sword has been tried for three months, and it has failed to answer the purpose. It has not bent the proud Moplah. Nor has it saved Hindus from his depredations and lust. The sword has merely prevented the Moplah from overrunning the whole of the Madras Presidency. It has exhibited no power of protection I am sure you will not plead incapacity. It is true that the police and the military are not transferred subjects. But you cannot escape moral responsibility. You are supporting the policy of the Government regarding Malabar. Nor, I hope, will you retort by blaming the non-co-operators. They cannot admit any responsibility for the trouble at all, unless all agitation is to be held blame-worthy I admit however that non-co- operators were not able to take their message to the Moplah homes. That would be a reason for more, not less, agitation. But I have not taken up the pen to argue away non-cooperators, blame. I ask you to consider the broad humanities of the question, compel the Government to suspend hostilities, issue promise of free pardon for past depredations upon an undertaking to surrender, and to permit non-co-operators to enter Malabar to persuade the Moplahs to surrender. I know that the last suggestion means the giving of importance to non-co-operators. Surely you do not doubt their numbers or influence. If you do, you should find other means of dealing with the trouble than that of extermination. I am merely concerned with the termination of the shameful inhumanity proceeding in Malabar with both Liberals and non-co-operators as helpless witnesses. I have chosen to address this letter not to the Government but to you, because the Government could not have taken the inhuman course of destruction without your moral support.

      "fullContent": "I have two pamphlets before me, one called Economics of Khadi by Sjt. Rajendra Prasad of Bihar, to be had of Bihar Charkha Sangha office, Muzaffarpur, for three annas. This pamphlet is the first of a series to be issued by Bihar Branch of the Charkha Sangha. The other is the report and accounts of the Gandhi Ashram, Tiruchengodu, conducted under the direction of Sjt. C. Rajagopalachari. This can be had from the Secretary, Gandhi Ashram, Tiruchengodu (S. India), for one-anna postage stamp. The first is a sustained argument put in a popular style and in a brief manner so as to enable the average busy reader to understand the economics of khadi. I must not attempt to resummarize the argument which is itself a summary of the case for the spinning- wheel. But it may be stated that after examining all the arguments for and against, Rajendra Babu has shown that only the spinning -wheel can successfully displace foreign cloth, and only the spinning-wheel can give a supplementary occupation to the twenty-two crores and forty lakhs of agriculturists of India who without the wheel are living, and must continue to live, in a condition of semi-starvation because they are and must be in a condition of unemployment at least for 120 days in the year. Sjt. Rajagopalachari’s report is a a scientific study in facts and figures, and seems entirely to illustrate and fortify Rajendra Babu’s argument. The reader will be interested to learn that 85% of the Ashram goes to the spinners and weavers, 9 1 2 % to the workers, and 5 1 2 % for other establishment charges. The report contains instructive and illustrative tables showing the earnings of spinners and weavers and dhobis, all of whom probably and the spinners certainly, but for the advent of the charkha,would not be getting the income they are receiving today. The report contains also a certified account of the income and expenditure of the Ashram activity. It devotes a page to show how the price one pays for khadi is distributed. Here are the figures: Cotton grower37 p.c. Spinners and weavers54 p.c. Workers6 p.c. Other expenses3 p.c. and it says: “Dress you must have, but if you choose to buy khadi, you help the re- construction of rural India.” This Ashram alone has distributed within 2 1 2 . years Rs. 1,24,536 among the poorest villagers surrounding it, and that not by way of charity but against work done in their own homes. The Ashram maintains a free dispensary, which during the past 11 months attended to 10,145 patients. 148 operations were performed during the period. The patients included the so-called untouchables.",

      "fullContent": "A correspondent sends me a Press cutting containing a report of an Allahabad judgement of two English judges sitting as appellate court. In delivering their judgment allowing the appeal their Lordships are reported to have said : The case is unsatisfactory because we have no less than five persons who were in effect, if their evidence can be relied upon, eye-witnesses, and yet, having regard to the slight value placed upon truth in this country, we have seriously to apply our minds as to whether they can be believed. This is an extraordinary pronouncement from a bench of judges. What legal basis had these two judges for the sweeping statement made by them as to the character of a whole nation ? The inference is that in other countries a higher value is placed upon truth. Now if this was a universally accepted proposition, perhaps the judges would have been justified in taking legal notice of it. There is, however, not only no such acceptance but experienced observers have testified that, on the whole, greater value is put upon truth in India than elsewhere. But no judge should be influenced one way or the other by such observations as have no judicial value. I would go further and say that such observations ought not to be made by any responsible person, even on political platforms. They can never be proved. But when they are made by judges they vitiate their judgments and may lead to miscarriage of justice. Be it noted that the Allahabad judges have made use of their bias in coming to their decision and have thus proved their incapacity to hold responsible posts. The case in which the observation was made affected poor people. But the fact that only poor persons were involved makes it all the more necessary to take public notice of the judges’ strictures. Who knows in how many cases this bias of theirs has resulted in defeating justice ? S EVAGRAM, April 2, 1940",

      "fullContent": "December 17, 1921 To imprison those who, whether high or low, break the commandments, to treat them as common felons, to deprive them of their prison privileges, one can understand. I would not call that foul play. If you incur the wrath of one who is over you or who has you under his power for the time being, to be punished by him for your disobedience is what you expect. But if he humiliates you, if he makes your children do things you and they do not like and which you are not required in law to do, if he treats you like dirt, it becomes unbearable. One learns that in Cocanada a Magistrate had the swaraj and the Khilafat flags pulled down, that he issued orders prohibiting the use of such flags for one week, that the children of a school were compelled to salute the Union Jack, that a distinguished Professor in Calcutta, going out in his academic costume and on the strength thereof going up to an officer to stop a wanton hunt of inoffensive men, was brutally assaulted for his innocent inquiry as to the cause of the hunt, that a party of brave cultured young men were kicked about by those who were their warders for the time being. These are things that sink. These humiliations show that there is little change in the manners of our”masters”. The O’Dwyerian spirit has not died out. Of what use is it that Lord Ronaldshay sends for the injured Professor, soothes him and assures him that the thing will not happen again? What will not happen again? The Professor will not be assaulted? Of course he will not be during the present crisis. The Professor himself will not again presume upon his academic costume and challenge an officer very soon. But has the officer any respect for the Professor? The Professor did not seek relief for himself. He interceded for injured humanity. Will Indian humanity be protected and respected in future because of His Lordship’s assurance? It is the habitual training given to the soldier that matters. He is converted into a vicious animal to be let loose on harmless people on given occasions. The Dases and the Azads have gone to jail to prevent a repetition of such unmanly and brutal exhibitions. They have welcomed imprisonment in order that even the worst criminal may be protected against wanton injury, that even he may not have his self-respect wounded. They have not gone to jail for any mechanical transference of power. The organic change they want, that Lala Lajpat Rai has been pining for years, that has become the breath of life for the ease-loving Motilal Nehru and has made of him practically a fakir, is not to be brought about by Lord Ronaldshay, however well-intentioned he may be in his apologies, nor by Lord Reading’s smooth phrases and his personal care that officers and men might not overstep the limits of law. The organic change will be and call only be brought about by the suffering that has come to the people and for which, thank God, they find themselves prepared. A cautious friend in order to restrain my optimism tells me, that the suffering has only just begun, that for the end in view we must pay a much higher price still. He really expects that we shall have to invite a repetition of Jallianwalas and that instead of approaching the triangles of the crawling lane fame tremblingly and reluctantly, we shall have now to walk to them cheerfully and with a steady step and suffer lashes for refusing to crawl.{1} I assure the friend that my optimism has room for all these things and much worse that he can imagine. But I promise, too, that if India remains calm and unperturbed and does not retaliate even mentally—a very dlflicult process I admit and yet not so difficult in India’s present exalted mood—our very preparedness and consequent absence of reaction will exhaust the brute spirit for want of nutrition, and Lord Reading, instead of talking big things to us, will himself adopt the human language of penitence and see ample occasion in the Indian atmosphere for a new diplomacy. Whereas if we forget ourselves and our pledge, we must be ready for a thousand Jallianwalas and India being turned into a vast shambles. The President elect has prepared us for such a consummation. He is sure that we have shed the fear of the prison. He is almost certain probably from the experience of his brave son and his company that we will be prepared to undergo the ordeal of assaults. But he bids us give up the fear of death itself. If that time is in store for us, I hope that there will be nonviolent non-co-operators enough in India, of whom it will be written: “They suffered bullets without anger and with prayer on their lips even for the ignorant murderer.” Well, if the reports are to be credited, two Assamese volunteers have been whipped, the volunteers of Lahore have meekly borne the wanton assaults committed on them. This fight is not a joke. We have disciplined ourselves for the past twelve months and more, and we must now go through it to the end. There is no turning back. Young India, 22-12-1921",

      "fullContent": "We shall now consider what vegetables should be avoided. In almost every part of India, it is customary to use chillies together with spices such as coriander seed, black pepper, etc. The practice does not obtain in other parts of the world to the same extent. If we offer any of our spicy dishes to the Negroes here, they also will hesitate to eat them as they do not care for their taste. Many white who are unused to spices are totally unable to eat our pungent food and, if they force themselves to eat it, their digestion suffers and the mouth gets inflamed. I have witnessed this myself in the case of some whites. We may conclude, therefore, that spices are not themselves appetizing but that, having become accustomed to them by long use, we like their smell and taste. We have already recognized, however, that eating anything for the sake of its taste is harmful to health. Let us then examine why people eat spices. They do so, it will be readily admitted, in order to be able to eat more and digest more. Chillies, coriander seed, cummin, etc., produce heat in the stomach and in consequence we seem to feel more hungry. If, however, we imagine from this that the food we have thus consumed is all digested and transformed into pure blood, we shall be sadly mistaken. Many people indulge in over-spicy food. Their stomachs become very weak in the long run and some even get attacks of sprue. A certain man used to eat large amounts of chillies, a habit which he could not overcome, and he died in his youth after a long illness which kept him on bed for six months. It is imperative that we eliminate spices from out diet altogether. This stricture applies equally to salt. No one will like this idea and some may even be aghast at it, but its truth has, nevertheless, been proved by experience. An association has been started in England whose creed is that salt is even more injurious than most spices. Our diet supplies salt to us in organic forms, and that is all that we really need. Sea-salt and rock-salt, on the other hand, are superfluous and when consumed are expelled again through perspiration and otherwise. This means that salt has no specific utility for the body. One book goes so far as to say that consumption of salt has a toxic effect on the blood and that one who has abstained from salt for many years and has otherwise kept his body clean has his blood stream so pure that even snake-bite will do him no harm; for the blood of such a person develops a resistance to the venom. We cannot ascertain the truth of this statement but from experience I can at least say that ailments such as cough, piles, asthma, bleeding, etc., respond immediately to a saltless diet. A certain Indian had long suffered from asthma and cough. These were cured by the adoption of a saltless diet together with the use of the usual remedies. I have not come across any undesirable results from giving up salt. I myself gave it up over two years ago and have felt no ill effect; on the contrary, I observe some beneficial effects. I need less water and feel less lethargic. The incident which occasioned my giving up salt was somewhat unusual, too. The person{1} whose ailment was responsible for my doing so has had her illness under control ever since. I am confident, too, that had the patient been able to give salt completely, her malady would have been entirely eradicated. I have observed during numerous experiments that people find it difficult to give up green vegetables and pulses together with the salt but this has to be done. I think these articles prove hard to digest without the addition of salt. This does not mean that salt stimulates digestion; on the contrary, just as chillies merely give the illusion of aiding the digestive process and are found to be harmful in the long run, so it is with salt. It follows, therefore, that those who adopt a saltless diet must give up green vegetables and pulses as well. Anyone can make this experiment and watch the effect on himself. Just as an opium addict who tries to rid himself of his habit feels out of sorts and weak at first, so is the case with one who refrains from salt. One should not, however, lose heart on this account. If the person who gives up salt is patient enough, he will be rewarded by and by. The writer has been bold enough to assert that even milk is among the articles to be avoided. One basis for this opinion is his own experience, but that should be kept out of consideration. We entertain so strong a superstition as to the value of milk that it would be a vain effort to combat it. The writer does not expect that his readers will agree with all the opinions he expresses in these articles, nor does he expect either that all those who approve of them will put them into practice; his object is only to present his ideas, leaving it to others to accept whatever they will. There is nothing wrong, therefore, in his writing even about milk. Many doctors have stated that milk is the cause of typhoid. Pamphlets have been published on this subject. Milk gets easily contaminated with airborne germs and those which are inimical to health multiply rapidly in it. We have to take a great deal of trouble to keep it in good condition. In South Africa there are special laws for consumers of milk. Very many recommendation are made for the preservation and storage of milk and cleaning of utensils. It seems reasonable to question whether it is worth while using an article which needs so much care to keep and which, if not so guarded, may do harm. Moreover, the goodness or otherwise of milk depends on the condition of the cow and what she eats. Doctors cite instances of persons drinking the milk of a tuberculous cow and themselves developing tuberculosis. It is difficult to find a perfectly healthy cow, and the milk of a diseased cow is unwholesome. It is well known that a sick mother’s milk makes the baby also sick. When a baby which has not yet been weaned falls ill, vaids treat the mother, so that through her milk the medicine may act on the baby. What is true of woman’s milk applies also to cow’s milk. In this way, the food and the health of the giver of milk have an intimate bearing on its consumer. Would not the right course be to avoid this milk, the consumption of which demands so much trouble and carries so much risk? The strength- giving property of milk is to be found in other substance as well. Olive oil is a good substitute for milk in many ways. A preparation of sweet almonds made by soaking them in hot water, peeling and grinding them to a fine paste and mixing this thoroughly with water, will have all the beneficial properties of milk and none of its risks. Finally, let us consider the law of Nature: a calf gives up sucking after a few months and, as soon as its teeth are developed, it turns to food which requires their use; this should be the rule with human beings, too. We are meant to take milk only so long as we are infants. We, too, should, when our teeth are grown, employ them in chewing fresh fruit such as apples and dry fruit such as almonds, or rotli. This is not the place to calculate how much money and time can be saved by anyone who has shaken off his slavery to milk, but each one will be able to find out for himself. Milk-products, too, are unnecessary. The acid content of whey is available from lemon and its other nutrients from almonds, etc. As to ghee, thousands of Indians consume oil instead. Let us now turn for a while to the third type of diet. It is a mixture of vegetarian and non-vegetarian elements. This diet is adopted by a large number of people, of whom many suffer from various ailments and many others are found to be healthy. That we are not meant to be meat-eaters, each one of our organs and the constitution of our bodies make evident. Dr. Kingsford and Dr. Haig have vividly described the ill effects of non-vegetarian diet on the body. They have proved that the acid produced by consumption of pulses is also produced by that of meat. Meat-eating damages the teeth and causes rheumatism. It makes a man more prone to anger, and therefore a sick man. According to our definition of health, one who is quick to get angry cannot be counted a healthy person. Those who eat the fourth and last type of diet, that is, who subsist exclusively on flesh, need not detain us here. Their state is so vile that the very thought of them should be enough to put us off meat-eating. They are not healthy in any sense of the term. As soon as they come up a little and get some knowledge, they tend to accept a vegetarian diet. What all this adds up to is that very few people will be found ready for an exclusively fruit diet, but that a diet of dry and fresh fruit, wheat and olive oil is worth a trial, it being possible to maintain sound health on it. Among fruits, bananas occupy the first place. Besides, dates, plums and figs are strength-giving fruits. Fresh grapes improve the blood. Orange, lemons and apples can be mixed with bananas and eaten with rotlis. The addition of olive oil to rotli does not impair its taste. Such a diet costs very little trouble or money and does not require salt and chillies, milk or sugar. Plain sugar is an absolutely useless article of food. People who are very fond of sweets lose their teeth early and the sweet food does them no good in any way. Wheat, almonds, peanuts, walnuts, fresh fruits—from every on of these a number of edible preparations can be made. What we have now to consider is how much food to eat and when; this we shall do in the next chapter.",

Normally it is proper for a prisoner to salaam the jailor, but if a satyagrahi does not salaam he should not be forced. If therefore force is used against someone for not salaaming it may become the duty of others also to refuse to salaam. It is surprising that the concessions provided in several other jails to satyagrahis have been denied to satyagrahis in this jail. In my opinion of course satyagrahi prisoners should be treated the same as other prisoners. But if a satyagrahi is treated in a particular way all other satyagrahis should be similarly treated. So far as the Congress is concerned there is no difference between Pathikji or Nrisinhdasji and the President. But how can one expect justice and fair play from this Government?

      "fullContent": "{1} Since a conference about Hostels is to be held this month in this city, I was asked to express my views as to what would be an ideal hostel. I have been running students’ hostels since 1904 according to my lights. I am therefore inclined to claim that I have some knowledge and experience of how hostels should be run and managed. Here, we would do well to take a wider sense of the term ‘hostel’. Every person who is learning anything is a student; and the place where more than one such student lives I consider a students’ hostel. The first and the most important condition for the success of such hostels is that the superintendents must be men of good character. A hostel should never be allowed to degenerate into a mere boarding-house, that is, a place where students live together for the sake of obtaining their meals. Students should cultivate a family feeling towards one another, and the superintendent should take the place of a father. He should take an interest in them, take part in their social life, and also have his meals with them. An ideal hostel would be almost more important to the student than school. In fact, the hostel is the real school. In schools or colleges the students get only verbal knowledge, while in the hostels they get all kinds of knowledge. An ideal hostel should not be a separate institution from the school; hence, both should be under the same management, and teachers and students should live together. Thus, we should make the hostels like home, and create in them ideal conditions for growth and development such as do not obtain even in real homes. Therefore, the thing to do would be to turn the hostels into gurukuls. There are many defects in our hostels. The reason lies in the fact that students lack a sense of belonging to a family group, and those who run them do not enter fully into the life of the students. Then, these hostels should be outside the city limits, and all the reforms which are considered necessary for the villages or cities should be carried out in them, that is, there must be the necessary arrangements for hygienic and sanitary living and the rules of such living should be strictly followed. An ideal hostel cannot be set up in a rented building. There should be good bath-rooms and latrines. The building should be well-ventilated and have a garden attached to it. An ideal hostel should be swadeshi in all respects—in the way the building is constructed, furnished and decorated. There should too be a reflection of village arts and crafts and way of life. The building itself should be in keeping with our needs and our means, considering the poverty of India. Thus, hostels, as built in prosperous and affluent Western countries, cannot serve as models for ours. Climatic conditions abroad and here differ. Hence, the type of building put up must be in accordance with prevailing conditions. There must be nothing in the ideal hostel which might encourage indolence and softness, or lead to waywardness. Therefore, the food served there should be simple—as becomes the life of seekers of knowledge. There should be regular prayers, and rules governing work, rest and sleep. An ideal hostel will be a brahmacharya ashram, i.e., a colony of students living the life of brahmacharis. The word ‘student’ is of recent origin—a modern word. The old word for a student— brahmachari—is richer in meaning and connotes the ideal of student life more truly. Brahmacharya or spiritual discipline—control of the senses, purity of body and mind, and devotion to studies with a view to attaining the Ultimate Reality—is absolutely necessary during the period of study. In the rather topsyturvy conditions obtaining today, I would like married students also, if admitted into the hostel, to observe brahmacharya until the completion of their studies. This means, among other things, that during this period they should live away from their wives. The reader should remember that I have described what would be an ideal hostel. It is understandable that all hostels may not be able to realize this goal. But, if the ideal described above is accepted as the standard, every hostel should strive to reach it, and assess its achievement by comparison with the ideal.",

      "fullContent": "{1} As Sardar Vallabhbhai was leaving Sevagram the other day he told me of a dacoity in a home{2} in Kheda District. Armed dacoits entered the house, belaboured the inmates, and escaped with the loot. The story was heart-rending. What should I do under similar circumstances, I thought to myself. What should Congressmen do in the circumstances was the next thought; and since then the train of thought arising from the dacoity has taken possession of me. The Congress has been working continuously since 1920 under the policy of non-violence. The province of Gujarat has also had the advantage of a leader of the Sardar’s calibre. And yet daring dacoities can take place. How far then can Congress influence be said to have penetrated? People imagine that, if the British Government were to cease to function today, it would be the non-violent Congressmen who would automatically take over. But it is not so. I have been working to this end for the last twenty years, but my dream has not materialized. For the Congress has not had a living faith in the very means which it adopted in 1920. Therefore the non-violence of the Congress has really been non-violence of the weak. But governments can only be run by the strong. And a non-violent government can only be run by those who believe that non-violence is the mightiest force on earth. If we had had this strength, there would be no HinduMuslim riots, there would be no robbers or dacoits. Some might say that for such strength you need either a Jesus or a Buddha. But this is not so. Neither Jesus nor Buddha tried non-violence in the political sphere, or it would be truer to say that the present-day type of politics did not exist in their day. The Congress experiment is, therefore, a new one. The tragedy is that Congressmen have not tried it with full faith, full understanding and sincerity. If they had had these three essential qualities, the Congress would today have been far taller than it is. But I may not cry over spilt milk. I refer to the past only in order to guide us in the present. Even if we wake up now, the game is ours; if we do not, we shall surely lose. Power invariably elects to go into the hands of the strong. That strength may be physical or of the heart, or, if we do not fight shy of the word, of the spirit. Strength of the heart connotes soul force. If today we decide that we should try to get power by force of arms, we shall have to undo all the work of twenty years among the masses. We shall have to spend a considerable time in giving people a contrary training. We cannot afford to give the required time at this critical juncture. It is certain that today whoever has any strength of any kind will use it for seizing power. It is my firm conviction that, if Congressmen are to get power, it should only be through non- violence or soul force. We have neither time nor material to do new work even in this line. When we have so far employed non-violence as a weapon of the weak, how can we all of a sudden expect to convert it into a weapon of the strong? But in spite of this I feel that at the present moment this experiment alone is feasible and proper for us. There is no risk involved in it. Even failure in it takes the form of success because, even if the people are not able to go the whole length in the experiment, they cannot possibly be led into a ditch. By following the way of physical force they may not only be proved cowards, but in attempting to follow an untrodden path thousands may also be destroyed. It is then the duty of Congressmen to seek out dacoits and robbers. They should try to understand and convert them. Such workers cannot be had for the asking; but Congressmen should know that this work is just as important as it is fraught with risk, and a certain number of them have to devote themselves to it. The second thing requisite is that we should prepare such workers as would, under difficult circumstances, stand up to dacoits and, whilst trying to check or convert them from their evil ways, be prepared to suffer hurt or even death. Perhaps few workers will be forthcoming for this task too, but peace brigades throughout the country are a definite necessity. Or else in times of chaos Congressmen will lose all the reputation they have so far gained{3} . Thirdly, the rich should ponder well as to what is their duty today. They who employ mercenaries to guard their wealth may find those very guardians turning on them. The monied classes have got to learn how to fight either with arms or with the weapon of non-violence. For those who wish to follow the latter way the best and most effective mantra is : — {4} (Enjoy thy wealth by renouncing it.) Expanded, it means : ‘Earn your crores by all means. But understand that your wealth is not yours; it belongs to the people. Take what you require for your legitimate needs, and use the remainder for society.’ This truth has hitherto not been acted upon; but, if the monied classes do not even act on it in these times of stress, they will remain the slaves of their riches and passions and consequently of those who overpower them. But I have visions that the end of this war will mean also the end of the rule of capital. I see coming the day of the rule of the poor, whether that rule be through force of arms or of non-violence. Let it be remembered that{5} physical force is transitory even as the body is transitory. But the power of the spirit is permanent, even as the spirit is everlasting. SEVAGRAM, January 25, 1942",

      "fullContent": "It is possible that the reader is being disturbed by the be- wildering changes he may be noticing at present in the Young India writings. I can assure him that they are not changes but they are a distinct advance in the direction we are going or should go. They are natural corollaries to the principles we profess. If we will remember that non-violence is more important than non-co-operation and that the latter without the former is a sin, what I am at present developing in these pages will be as clear as daylight. The difficulty, however, is that the reader does not know much of what is going on behind the scenes. I am restraining myself partly on purpose and partly because I cannot do otherwise. It is difficult to pass on decisions from moment to moment and from day to day to the fellow-workers. I must simply trust that as they are in my opinion the necessary corollary to the main principle, they will be as plain to the reader as they are to me. The fact is, action must vary with every varying circumstance. It is not inconsistent, if it springs from the same source. What must be however apparent to everyone is that our differences are increasing. Each group is making of its programme a matter of principle. Each sincerely believes that its programme will bring us nearer to the common goal. So long as there is a body of people in the country—and it is a large if not a growing body—so long will there be parties prosecuting the Councils programme. Our non-co-operation therefore has taken the form of non-co-operation in practice with one another instead of the Government. Without wishing it we are weakening one another and to that extent helping the system we are all seeking to destroy. Let us recognize its chief characteristic. It is parasitical and derives nutrition from the fungi of national life. Our non-co-operation was meant to be a living, active, non-violent force matched against the essential violence of the system. Unfortunately the non-co-operation never became actively non-violent. We satisfied ourselves with physical non-violence of the weak and helpless. Having failed to produce the immediate effect of destroying the system, it has recoiled upon us with double strength and now bids fair to destroy us, if we do not take care betimes. I, for one, am therefore determined not to participate in the domestic wrangle but would even invite all concerned to do likewise. If we cannot actively help, we must not hinder. I am just as keen a believer as ever in the five boycotts. But I clearly see, as I did not at the time of the A.l.C.C. meeting, that whilst we maintain them in our own persons, there is no atmosphere for working them. There is too much distrust in the air. Every action is suspected and misinterpreted. And whilst we carry on a war of explanation and counter-explanation, the enemy at the door is rejoicing and consolidating his forces. We must avoid this almost at any cost. I have therefore suggested that we should find out the lowest common measure among all the political parties and invite them all to co-operate on the Congress platform for achieving that common measure. This is the work of internal development without which there will be no effective external political pressure. The politicians who put the external work before the internal, or who think (which is the same thing) that the internal is too slow for them, should have the greatest freedom to develop their strength, but in my opinion, this should be outside the Congress platform. The Congress must progressively represent the masses. They are as yet untouched by politics. They have no political consciousness of the type our politicians desire. Their politics are confined to bread and salt—I dare not say butter, for millions do not know the taste of ghee or even oil. Their politics are confined to communal adjustments. It is right however to say that we the politicians do represent the masses in opposition to the Government. But if we begin to use them before they are ready, we shall cease to represent them. We must first come in living touch with them by working for them and in their midst. We must share their sorrows, understand their difficulties and anticipate their wants. With the pariahs we must be pariahs and see how we feel to clean the closets of the upper classes and have the remains of their table thrown at us. We must see how we like being in the boxes, miscalled houses, of the labourers of Bombay. We must identify ourselves with the villagers who toil under the hot sun beating on their bent backs and see how we would like to drink water from the pool in which the villagers bathe, wash their clothes and pots and in which their cattle drink and roll. Then and not till then shall we truly represent the masses and they will, as surely as I am writing this, respond to every call. “We cannot all do this, and if we are to do this, good-bye to swaraj for a thousand years and more,” some will say. I shall sympathize with the objection. But I do claim that some of us at least will have to go through the agony and out of it only will a nation full, vigorous and free be born. I suggest to all that they should give their mental co-operation and that they should mentally identify themselves with the masses, and as a visible and tangible token thereof, they should earnestly spin for at least thirty minutes per day in their name and for their sake. It will be a mighty prayer from the intelligentsia among the Hindus, Mussalmans, Parsis, Christians and others of India, rising up to heaven for their, that is, India’s deliverance. I see no way of removing the Hindu-Muslim tension, which is becoming daily tenser, save by all the parties coming together on the Congress platform and devising the best method of solving a problem which seems to defy solution and to dash to pieces all the fond hope, we had of securing a national freedom that is broad-based upon mutual trust and mutual help. If for no other reason, let us, at least for the sake of achieving unity, give up the internecine political strife. Here is my proposal to that end: 1. The Congress should suspend all the boycotts except that of foreign cloth till the session of 1925. 2. The Congress should, subject to (I), remove the boycott of Empire goods. 3. The Congress should confine its activity solely to the propaganda of hand-spinning and hand-spun khaddar, the achievement of Hindu-Muslim unity, and in addition, its Hindu members’ activity to the removal of untouchability. 4. The Congress should carry on the existing national edu- cational institutions; and if possible, open more and keep them independent of Government control or influence. 5. The four-anna franchise should be abolished and in its place the qualification for membership should be spinning by every member for half an hour per day and delivery to the Congress from month to month of at least 2,000 yards of self-spun yarn, cotton being supplied where the member is too poor to afford it. It is necessary to say a word about the proposed radical change in the Congress constitution. I may be pardoned for saying that I am the principal author of the Congress constitution. It was intended to be the most democratic in the world, and if successfully worked, to bring swaraj without more. But it was not so worked. We had not sufficient honest and able workers. It must be confessed that it has broken down in the sense in which it was intended. We never had even one crore of members on the roll. At the present moment probably our nominal roll does not exceed two lakhs for all India. And the vast majority of these too are as a rule not interested in our proceedings save for paying four annas and voting. But what we need is an effective, swift moving, cohesive, responsive organization containing intelligent, industrious national workers. Even if we are a few only, we should give a better account of ourselves than a cumbrous and slow body with no mind of its own. The only boycott proposed to be retained is that of foreign-cloth and if we are to make it successful, we can only do so by making the Congress for a time predominantly a spinners’ association. It will be a great triumph and a great demonstration, if we succeed in one constructive item of a striking magnitude. I hold that the only possible thing of the kind is hand-spinning and hand-spun khaddar. If we are to make of khaddar a national success, the spinning-wheel is the only thing. If we are permanently to interest the masses in the national welfare of the country, the spinning-wheel is the only medium. If we are to banish pauperism from the land, the spinning-wheel again is the only remedy. The implications of my proposals are that (a) the Swarajists should be free to organize themselves without any opposition from the Congress or No-changers; (b) the members of other political bodies should be invited and induced to join the Congress; (c) the No-changers should be precluded from carrying on any propaganda either direct or indirect against Council-entry; (d) those who do not personally believe in any of the four boycotts will be free, without any disgrace whatsoever, to act as if they did not exist. Thus non-co-operating lawyers will be free to resume practice if they chose and title-holders, school-masters, etc., will be free to join the Congress and be eligible to the executive. The scheme enables all the political parties to work unitedly for the internal development. The Congress presents a suitable opportu- nity for a conference of all political parties and outside the Congress to frame a swaraj scheme acceptable to all and for presentation to the Government. Personally I am of opinion that time has not arrived for any such presentation. I believe that it would increase our internal strength beyond expectation if we could all simply unite to make the foregoing constructive programme a success. But a large number of those who have hitherto led the country think otherwise. In any event a swaraj scheme for the sake of ourselves is a necessity. As the reader will remember, I am in this matter a complete convert to Babu Bhagwandas’s{1} view. I would therefore join any such conference, if my presence was required, and assist at framing the scheme. The reason for insisting on this matter being treated as an activity outside the Congress is to keep the Congress purely for internal development for full one year. When we have achieved a measure of success commensurate with the task before us, the Congress may function for outside political activity. What if the proposal is not accepted and it is found difficult to bring together all parties on the Congress platform and to heal the breach between the Swarajists and ourselves? My answer is simple. If the whole fight is for ‘‘capturing” the Congress, I must refuse to enter upon it. I would advise all who think with me to do likewise. I would advise handing the Congress over to the Swarajists on their terms and leave the Swarajists to work the Councils programme unhampered by any counter-propaganda. I would engage the No-changers purely on the constructive programme and advise them to seek such help from the other parties as they can give. Those who depend for national regeneration solely on the constructive programme may be expected to lead in the matter of self-sacrifice. Not one of the things we hold dear can be achieved by trying to retain power in the Congress in opposition to the Swarajists. We must hold it on their sufferance. Both parties will be guilty of corrupting the simple people who worship the name”Congress”, if they are made at our bidding to engage in a suicidal tug-of-war. Power that comes from service faithfully rendered ennobles. Power that is sought in the name of service and can only be obtained by a majority of votes is a delusion and a snare to be avoided, especially at the present moment. Whether I have convinced the reader of the soundness of my proposal or not my mind is made up. It hurts me to think that those with whom I have hitherto worked hand in glove should be working in a seemingly opposite direction. What I have sketched above is not conditions of surrender. Mine is an unconditional surrender. I would guide the Congress next year only if all parties wish me to. I am trying to see daylight out of this impenetrable darkness. I seem to see it dimly. But I may be still wrong. All I know is that there is no fight left in me. This is much for a born fighter to say. I have fought my dearest ones. But I fight out of love. I should fight the Swarajists too out of love. But I must, I see, first prove my love. I thought I had proved it. I see I was wrong. I am therefore retracing my steps. I ask everyone to help me to do so and to reunite the two wings on a common platform. The Congress must, for sometime to come at least, remain largely a homogeneous body.",

      "fullContent": "NATAL DEPUTATION A special meeting of the Committee was called to meet the Natal deputation. It took place on Wednesday last and was attended by Lord Ampthill, Sir Raymond West, Mr. Thornton, Sir Muncherji Bhownaggree, Mr. Polak and Mr. Ritch. Mr. Anglia ac-quainted Sir Raymond with the whole position. Lord Ampthill asked for all the documents. He will go through them himself. After reading Lord Crewe’s reply, he felt that there was nothing more to be done. Mr. Anglia has placed all the facts before the editor of the Daily Telegraph, London. Lord Crewe has replied that the matter is receiving the attention of both Lord Morley and himself. Even the fact that he has replied to say that he is thinking about the Natal problem shows that he has been influenced by the Transvaal. He is afraid lest Natal, too, should resort to satyagraha. Mr. Amod Bhayat is returing by the same ship which will carry this letter. He thinks no more remains to be done here. Mr. Anglia, it appears, will be here as long as the Transvaal deputation remains. Probably Mr. Abdul Caadir will do the same. “ETHICS OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE” Mr. Gandhi gave a lecture under this title on Friday evening to members of the Union of Ethical Societies at Emerson Club. Miss Winterbottom took the chair on the occasion. Many Indians were present. They included Sir Muncherji, Mr. Pal, Mr. Parikh and others. Miss Joshi and Mrs. Dube had also turned up. The burden of Mr. Gandhi’s speech was that soul force is far superior to brute force, and that it is invincible. Afterwards, a number of questions were answered. The Transvaal problem was raised and everyone was moved by the tale of our sufferings. There was a speech by Mr. Pal, in which he argued that soul force should be backed by physical force. Mr. Gandhi replied that, in that case it would not deserve the name of soul The original has “Lucknow”, an obvious misprint. Vide “Speech at Emerson Club”, 8-10-1909 force. There were speeches by Mrs. Tedman and Mrs. Polak. Mr. Ritch also spoke. SUFFRAGETTE FUNCTION On the 7th there was a very big gathering of suffragettes in a large hall called Albert Hall. It was attended by hundreds of women. There were speeches by Mrs. Pankhurst and others. Enthusiasm ran so high that a sum of about £3,000 in cash was received on the spot in aid of the struggle. About four of them paid £250 each. In all, the women have collected £51,000 by now. Their journal has a weekly circulation of about 50,000. They appeared determined to fight till death. Leaving aside their use of physical force, they deserve to be emulated for their spirit, their enthusiasm and their intelligence. Their organisation is unrivalled by men. They have, it may be said, a huge army of volunteers. There is no limit to their resourcefulness. They go through extreme suffering. Many a woman has allowed herself to be reduced to poverty for the sake of franchise. Many have given up their jobs. This is no ordinary fight. It will be enough if the Indians follow their example. Only, we should avoid imitating them in their use of physical force. We may be sure that no good will come out of it. MY HOPE Mr. Amod Bhayat is returning with a full knowledge of all this. He has been convinced that the Transvaal campaign has been of benefit to Natal as well. He has also been able to see that even the people here get no justice by making petitions. Everyone knows that a petition carries no weight. I hope, therefore, that after returning there, Mr. Amod Bhayat will take to satyagraha. In any case, he has promised to help the satyagraha campaign in the Transvaal.",

      "fullContent": "The Students’ Association of the Gujarat Vidyapith conducted an inquiry to find out the views of its ex-students about national education, their ideological and financial position, etc., and has brought out its findings in the form of a small pamphlet. It is now a year since the pamphlet was published. It has been constantly with me on my travels, and though it is rather late it will still not be out of place to give a summary of the results mentioned in the pamphlet, in view of its usefulness. The number of graduates who passed out of the Vidyapith from 1921 to 1926 was 251. Omitting those from Sind and Madras, a questionnaire was sent to more than 200 students. of them 82, including two ladies, sent in their replies. The pamphlet mentioned above gives an excellent summary of their replies, which should be read by those eager to make a study of national education. Here I can give only a few hurriedly jotted points: Replies as to why they quit Government schools are as below: Out of political fervour33 Because of faith in non-co-operation10 Because of conviction of the need for national education10 In obedience to the call of the nation11 At the instance of relatives 6 Being carried away by the prevailing current12 Total82 Of these, one student writes the following about the conditions under which he non-co-operated: “I left my college against the advice of the elders in my family and caste, and against that of the institutions which were helping me. I thus lost the monthly scholarship of Rs. 10 which I was getting at the Government college.” The following are a few of the opinions given by the ex-students about the atmosphere of the Gujarat Mahavidyalaya, i.e., the college section of the Vidyapith: “There was great freedom. A notable fact was that the Mahavidya laya completely changed my life. I might say that it brought about a rebirth for me.” “To begin with the atmosphere was political but afterwards it underwent a change. On the whole, it was such as to foster noble thoughts, though one cannot say that it also gave the power to translate those thoughts into action or even prepared us for that.” “The distinction of the Vidyapith lay in its religious and pure atmosphere.” “Throughout the three years I spent there the atmosphere was so good and uplifting that I dare say one could not find it anywhere else in India.” “The atmosphere was very helpful both for study and contemplation.” “Gujarat Vidyapith shows us the path, direct and straight, as to how a man can lead the highest kind of life. The atmosphere prevailing there offered me the best opportunities for the experience of life in the world —a gift by no means inconsiderable when one comes to think of its importance in one’s own life.” “The atmosphere was very pure. There was not that narrow-mindedness which one comes across in Government schools and colleges. Everybody had the utmost freedom which was very helpful in the intellectual development of the students. At the same time there was also scope for the boys to abuse the freedom because not having had it before they could also misuse it. Under the circumstances there is little danger of the boys’ mental deterioration.” At the time the pamphlet was prepared, the graduates were employed as follows: In educational institutions Total l. Vidyapith 9 2. Recognized or unrecognized national schools 21 3. Government schools 7 37 In institutions for depressed classes l. Institutions for untouchables 2 2.,, Bhils 2 3.,, Kaliparaj l 4.,, Labour 3 8 Independent employment 1. Agriculture, business, etc. 11 2. Private employment, business, office jobs, etc. 18 3. Legal practice 2 4. Journalism 3 5. Not engaged in any parti cular profession 3 82 The readers will note that out of 82 as many as 45 were earning their living through social service work. As for the figures of their earnings, no one earned less than thirty rupees a month. Twelve graduates were earning sixty rupees per month. The number of those who had a monthly income of seventy-five rupees was 15. One of the graduates was earning Rs. 200, another Rs. 130 and three earned Rs. 125. Thus those who earned from Rs. 50 to Rs. 200 were 57. Eighteen graduates could not send the figures for their incomes because they were engaged in independent business or professional work. It would not be an exaggeration to say that these results are very satisfactory. Graduates of Government universities are of ten found to be earning even less than 30 rupees a month. Here there is only one who gets 30 rupees and very likely he too is doing so voluntarily as a sort of discipline. Today there are many among the educated in India who are ready to take up service for no more than a living—for just enough to keep body and soul together. We have seen that of the aforementioned, 42 are already engaged in social service work. And this is indeed the ideal which the Vidyapith seeks to set before its graduates, namely, that they should take up some sort of social service work at just a subsistence wage. As against this, the ideal in a Government university, if it can be called an ideal, is, understandably, career, i.e., a lucrative profession meaning mainly to secure Government service. A national institution devotes itself to training national workers, while a Government university addresses itself to preparing Government servants whom we consider to be slaves. In a national college service is its own reward while in a Government college there is the inducement of a rise in salary and the promise of a pension. The only pension a national worker can look for lies in the hope that there is in every man the instinct of grateful appreciation of pure service and that the people cannot fail to develop love and regard for their benefactors. That is why I regard the result mentioned above as excellent. The figures for monthly income prove that the graduates of the national university are able to make enough income even in the sphere of service. And as time passes, and the spirit of sacrifice spreads, I hope to see a reduction made in the above earnings, not of course by force but voluntarily. As long as crores of our people are starving, a man who takes two rupees when he can do with one is really guilty of thieving. The following extracts are from the replies to the question “What would you prefer to adopt as your life-work?” “To be a soldier in the struggle for the freedom of the country and society” “Any such activity as will enable me to take part in doing service to the country” “Education and khadi” “Harijan work or work in the primary or secondary schools in villages” “I will have the satisfaction of having done my life-work if I could have the opportunity to serve the people in any form.” These graduates of the Gujarat Vidyapith admit the superiority of national education and its many advantages. Nevertheless, they have not hesitated to express their view that national education in its present form is imperfect. This freedom of thought raises the pamphlet’s worth. The figures given below show that up to 1926 only a small number had appreciated the value of sacrificial spinning: Those who spin for an hour or more daily 5 Those who spin only for half an hour 10 Those who spin 1000 yards per month 9 Irregular spinners 9 Those who did not spin 49 82 This indifference towards a thing which people like me regard as a great yajna, whose importance has been ever recognized by the Congress in its resolutions, is certainly disappointing. But I know that there has been an improvement in the situation after 1926 and I am therefore satisfied. The number of those who stuck to pure khadi for their clothing was 56 which, though inadequate, may yet be regarded as fair, seeing that something is better than nothing. of course, there were others who used khadi to a limited extent. Those who did not use khadi explain their difficulties thus: “We have to work among the people who belittle our value on account of the simplicity of khadi. This results in less work for us and therefore less earning.” “The dearness of khadi, the difficulty of getting it, and the keen desire for fine mill-cloth are a hindrance.” “Ready-made garments of mill-cloth are available at the shops at very cheap prices, It is not so with khadi.” That such excuses are put forward to explain why they do not use khadi shows that many do not yet know what a great help khadi is to the starving poor and what a great contribution it is making to our freedom struggle. It is to be remembered that no country has won freedom in this world without suffering privations and difficulties. It would be very useful if developments in respect of khadi and other things, subsequent to the publication of the pamphlet, could be made available. I congratulate the editors on bringing out this pamphlet. Every national worker can learn much from it. The Association would do well to continue their inquiry. It should be the primary object of the Association to maintain spiritual contact with all the graduates of the Vidyapith, share their joys and sorrows and not allow a slackening of the ideals for which the Vidyapith has been founded. I feel that those who read this pamphlet cannot but come to the conclusion that the national schools and colleges have done much good to the country, and that the strength which we find in the students today owes its origin to these institutions. I have had the same experience in regard to the results of the work of the Kashi Vidyapith as of those of the Gujarat Vidyapith which have been noted above and I am sure that the same will be found to be true, on examination, in the case of the Jamia Millia and the Bihar Vidyapith. I also advise the Association to establish contacts with all the national universities, and collect and collate all information about them. It may perhaps be desirable to hold occasional or annual conferences of the teachers and graduates of these universities. Professor Gidwani had, in fact, attempted this. If such a conference is held, it should not synchronize with the Congress week. Our tendency to hold all conferences simultaneously with it is, I think, harmful. It distracts people’s energy instead of concentrating it; and the people gain little from these conferences. If a conference is worth holding it should be held separately. It is not possible that all people would be interested in all the conferences. Rightly the Congress is the organization which should interest all people. Therefore, during the Congress week, the people’s attention should be directed to the sole purpose of strengthening the Congress.",

      "fullContent": "The thundering clouds have burst at last. The much-disussed Punjab Commission has now been appointed. It consists of Lord Hunter, Mr. Rankin, Mr. Rice, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad, Sahibzada Sultan Ahmed and Sir George Burrow. The Commission will inquire into the causes of the disturbances which broke out in April in the Punjab and other places, and into the steps which were taken to control them and will make recommendations. The Commission will commence its sessions next month. We gather this from the speech of His Excellency the Viceroy at the opening of the Legislative Assembly. Lord Hunter was Solicitor General of Scotland in 1910-11. Mr. Rankin is a Judge of the Calcutta High Court. All Gujaratis know Sir Chimanlal Setalvad. Sahibzada Sultan Ahmed is a brother of Sahibzada Aftab Ahmed Khan, a member of the India Council. He was in the Justice Department of the Gwalior State for a long time; Mr. Rice is a member of the Services and was for several year Chief Secretary in Burma. Sir George Burrow is a Major-General. Thus we find persons from all fields appointed on the Commission as members. It must be said that a good balance has been maintained. Only experience will show whether the members prove themselves independent. Sir Chimanlal Setalvad is a friend and pupil of that able leader, the late Sir Pherozeshah{1}; hence we may take it that he will remain impartial and independent. What we know about Sahibzada Sultan Ahmed is not much and the same can be said about the other members. As Lord Hunter comes from an outside atmosphere, we may hope that he will display the qualities of firmness and impartiality which a chairman ought to possess. That the work of the Committee will be generally open to the public will go a long way in ensuring justice. Whether or no we get justice will, ultimately, depend largely on ourselves. There is no doubt that members of the Commission cannot but do justice if everywhere experienced men give evidence before it. If the people fearlessly present the facts as they know them, we are confident that the truth about the atrocities perpetrated in the Punjab will fully come out. From the published speech of the Viceroy, it can be inferred that the terms of reference of the Commission include a review of the sentences already passed. But the position will be known more definitely by and by.",

      "fullContent": "“ VARNASHRAMA” OR “ VARNASANKARA” ? A fair friend writes: A fellow traveller drew my attention to the message{1} of yours to the Rajput Parishad of Vartej. By reading it a protest which was lying suppressed in the subconscious level of the mind made its way to the surface and claimed a hearing. Man is one who does manan or thinking. So I hope you will be tolerant to a fellow thinker and give an attentive hearing to thoughts that may run counter to your habitual ones. These thoughts had occurred at the first sight of the Sabarmati Ashram with its weaving shed in 1920, had disappeared and reappeared off and on, till of late they have been busy building a permanent abode in my mind for which your message to the Rajputs has supplied the straw for the last brick. In a place where the whole station was lined from one end to the other with volunteers dressed in military style with swords hanging at their sides, where the whole air was redolent with reminiscences of bravery and chivalry of men of the military caste of India, was not your message urging them in a way to substitute the music of your wheel for the music of their sword a preaching of the dharma of your caste to all castes ad absurdum, like the Christian missionary? Should you not rather, like the sages of ancient India, exhort a Brahmin to be a true Brahmin, a Kshatriya to be an ideal Kshatriya and a Vaisya to be a model Vaisya? The insignia of the Brahmin is the book or pen, of the Kshatriya the sword, and of the Vaisya the wheel or the plough. You may well pride yourself in being called a weaver or an agriculturist as thereby you are true to the natural tendencies of your jati or to Vaisya dharma. But why would you a Hindu, a believer in varnashrama principles, help in the degra- dation of a Brahmin or a Kshatriya by insisting on their accepting Vaisya dharma and rejecting or neglecting their respective jati dharmas? Can a Kshatriya not serve and protect the poor even in these days but in the Vaisya way? The great men of India have always upheld swadharma for each individual temperament. You are the first of them to preach the throwing in of the dharmas of all people into the same melting pot and thereby Vaisyaising the whole nation. Uplift the Vaisya by all means, but pray do not pull the Brahmins and the Kshatriyas by their legs. Spiritualize your caste people, but do not materialize the men of other castes by turning them into spinners and weavers with the spell of your personality. To my thinking a Vinoba and a Balkoba would have rendered more potent service to the nation as pure Brahmins with their intellects fully developed rather than as spiritual weavers which you have turned them into. I have not reproduced the whole of the letter but I have given the cream of it. The rest is a commentary on the extract quoted by me. The friend is born and claims to be a Hindu even as I claim to be one. As I have regarded spinning to be superior to sectional religions, I had hoped that I would not be misunderstood by cultured friends. But it was not to be. The friend tells me she is not the only one to oppose the charkha. I must, therefore, endeavour patiently to examine the argument. I have noted in the course of my journalistic experience dating from 1904 that most of the criticism received by editors is based upon an imperfect under-standing of an opponent’s statement. In the case in point, if only the friend had borne in mind that I had presented the message of the wheel, not to the Hindus alone, but to all Indians without exception, to men and women, to Mussalmans, Parsis, Christians, Jews, Sikhs and all others who claimed to be Indians, she would have written differently. She would then have inferred that I had placed before the people of India something which not only did not come in conflict with the several religions but which, in so far as it was taken up, added lustre to one’s own religion and, in Hinduism, to one’s own varna or caste. Mine, therefore, I claim to be a method not of confusion but cleansing. I ask no one to forsake his own hereditary dharma or occupation, but I ask everyone to add spinning to his natural occupation. The Rajputs of Kathiawar knew this. They asked me whether I wanted them to give up their swords. I told them I wanted them to do no such thing. On the contrary, I added, I wanted each one of them to possess a trusty sword so long as they believed in it. But I certainly told them that my ideal Rajput was he who defended without the sword and who died at his post without killing. A sword may be snatchedfrom one, not so the bravery to die without striking. But this is by the way. For my purpose, it is enough to show that the Rajputs were not to give up their calling of protecting the weak. Nor do I want the Brahmins to give up their vocation as teachers. I have suggested to them that they become better teachers for sacrificial spinning. Vinoba and Balkoba are better Brahmins for having become spinners and wea-vers and scavengers. Their knowledge is more digested. A Brahmin is one who knows God. Both these fellow- workers are nearer God today by reason of their having felt for and identified themselves through spinning with the starving millions of India. Divine knowledge is not borrowed from books. It has to be realized in oneself. Books are at best an aid, often even a hindrance. A learned Brahmin had to learn divine wisdom from a godfearing butcher. What is this varanashrama? It is not a system of water-tight compartments. It is a recognition to me of a scientific fact whether we know it or not. A Brahmin is not only a teacher. He is only predo- minantly that. But a Brahmin who refuses to labour will be voted down as an idiot. The rishis of old who lived in the forests cut and fetched wood, tended cattle and even fought. But their pursuit in life was pre-eminently search after Truth. Similarly, a Rajput without learning was good for nothing, no matter how well he wielded the sword. And a Vaisya without divine knowledge suffi-cient for his own growth will be a veritable monster eating into the vitals of society, as many modern Vaisyas, whether of the East or the West, have become. They are, according to the Gita ‘incarnations of sin who live only for themselves’. The spinning-wheel is designed to wake up everyone to a sense of his duty. It enables every-one better to fulfil his dharma or duty. When a vessel is running on smooth waters, work on board is exquisitely divided. But when it is caught in the grip of a violent storm and is about to sink, everyone has to give a helping hand to the necessary work of life-saving. Let us also bear in mind that, with the rest of the world, India finds herself in the deadly coil of the mercantile cobra. It is a nation of shop-keeping soldiers that claims to rule her. It will tax all the resources of all her best Brahmins to unwind India from that coil. Her learned men and her soldiers will, therefore, have to bring their learning and their prowess to bear upon the mercantile require-ments of India. They must, therefore, in order to be able faithfully to carry out their dharma, learn and practise spinning. Nor have I the least hesitation in recommending hand-wea-ving as a bread-winning occupation to all who are in need of an honest occupation. To the Brahmins, the Kshatriyas and others, who are at the present moment not following their hereditary occu-pation, but are engaged in the mad rush for riches, I present the honest and (for them) selfless toil of the weaver and invite them, with a view to return- ing to their respective dharmas, to be satisfied with what little the handloom yields to them. Just as eating, drink-ing, sleeping, etc., are common to all castes and all religions, so must spinning be common to all without exception whilst the confusion, selfish greed and resul- ting pauperism persist. Mine, therefore, is a method not of making varnasankara—confusion worse confounded—but it is one of making varnashrama—cleansing more secure.",

      "fullContent": "The destruction wrought by the heavy floods in Gujarat appears to be of an unprecedented character. The meagre accounts I have seen in the Press supplemented by two telegrams from Vallabhbhai Patel and one from the Ashram gave me but a faint idea of the enormous damage done by the flood. I am handicapped, too, as I am writing this in an out-of-the-way place in Mysore where newspapers reach very late. When communications are thoroughly established, the total extent of the damage done will probably be found to be much heavier than the estimates made by responsible workers. Benevolent and wealthy gentlemen of Bombay and Gujarat have been as prompt in their work of mercy as Nature has been furious in her work of destruction. Sjt. Vallabhbhai Patel has already issued an appeal. I hope that there will be a liberal response to the appeal. A private telegram tells me that Sir Purushottamdas Thakordas has also, as is his wont on such occasions, started relief work. On occasions of such calamities when deepest emotions are stirred,many relief agencies are brought into being to render help. They must be all welcome. Not one agency can hope to overtake the whole work of relief over such a vast area. However, it will be the duty of several agencies to co-operate with one another, so as to avoid overlapping and so as to make every rupee go to the longest length and every grain of wheat find its way to the neediest hands. Let those whom God has blessed with ability to give remember the proverb : “He gives twice who gives the quickest.”",

      "fullContent": "I give below the gist of what a Harijan from Karachi has written to me, retaining his broken language as far as possible: The sense of pollution through touch is much stronger among women. More so against the Dhed Harijans. They throw down to them stale, dirty, rotten left-over food. The women believe that only stale and rotten food should be given to the Bhangis. They are convinced that this is proper. The Bhangi men and women as a matter of course believe that they are getting their morning meal in return for their scavenging work. If they Hindu society stops giving rotten food to the Bhangi and the other communities, I can humbly say that pollution will disappear from the women. Youwill have to plead further with women to shed the superstitious notion of pollution through touch. I have given the above as the substance of along letter. Untouchability will not be eradicated merely by women giving good food to the Harijan brethren instead of left-overs, but if they did that, certainly it would be said that they women had some compassion in their hearts. The complaint against women is a genuine one. If they wish, they can forthwith effect this reform. This does not involve a question of money but only a change of heart. The woman in whose heart God dwells can readily accept a harijan as a fellow-being. The students of Dehra Dun had raised the same question and what I wrote{1} in reply to it applies here also. By controlling their palate, the women can give a clean share of food to the Harijans without adding to the expense by a single pie. I have a childhood memory. Many times my mother ate after feeding a sadhu. She would serve out lovingly what shee herself was to eat and having fed him thus she would take here meal and feel rewarded. Similarly, how nice it would be if women took out the share for the Harijans first and then served the other! In this case, a Harijans ceases to be a beggar but becomes a family member or a guest. She would feed him lovingly and merely by doing this she would make that Harijan clean. Instead of proudly throwing food from upstairs, she would hand over the food herself to the Bhangi and, if she found his hands dirty, she would ask him to clean them. If he does not have clean clothes, she would provide them. She would buy utensils for him or would given him only dry and un- cooked food or would increase his wages. When a Bhangi develops self-respect he will, others, accept payment only. Before such a time comes, I have suggested only interim reforms. Many reforms will occur to women themselves when they have had a change of heart, when the ghost of untouchability has been exorcized and when the feeling that Harijans are inferior is removed. Without waiting for anyone to take up this work on a large scale, a woman who feels the need for this reform should make a beginning with herself and then invite her neighbours to join her.",

      "fullContent": "May 7, 1929 I tender my thanks to you for the addresses of welcome and for the money that you have given me for the Khadi Fund. There are certain matters in the addresses presented to me and let me say a few words regarding them. I have not forgotten the fact that I visited this place some time back. Among others, I take first the address of welcome presented by the Municipal Council, in which the problems of untouchability has been referred to. It is also stated there that “We members of the Council, look forward with great hopes when your efforts forcomplete prohibition (of drink and other intoxicants) would attain success.” It is very surprising to me to see these two references. Let me tell you, the work is not mine alone in the matter of prohibition and the removal of untouchability. The responsibility lies more on the Municipal Councillors than on a private individual, and it rests very largely on the intelligent public. It would be an illusion that I am going to achieve these miracles. I am only urging you to be awake to your duty to your country which is now in intense suffering on account of these two evils. If we do not do our duty by our motherland, we will have been born in vain, and we would not be doing our dharma. I wish to place another matter before the Municipal Council for consideration. While I was coming here, I noticed that a road was particularly bad and some were badly kept. Truly you must make your Municipality an ideal municipality. This is considered to be a very sacred place and many come here to bathe in the Gautami, and if all filth and sewage water is to be found outside, what do you think the result will be ultimately? It is therefore necessary that the town should be kept neat and clean and sanitary without any stench. But you know it better than I do. I congratulate the Municipality on its khaddar work. . . . I hear that there is one Hindu Samaj working here for a very long time but Mr. N. Subba Rao Pantulu (the President of that Samaj) tells me that it is not now running satisfactorily. Those who recognize Hindu dharma ought to take interest in the study of the Bhagavad Gita. It is regrettable that people do not evince sufficient interest when there is such a useful institution by their side to study Bhagavad Gita and learn the guiding principles of their life. References have been made in the addresses to the varanganas (the fallen sisters). It is a matter for deep shame that there should be still a class of our sisters living the life of prostitution. You should not rest satisfied until there is not even one fallen sister amongst you. You must not sleep until you accomplish this and wipe out the blot of the whole nation. Remember that this could be done only through your purity and moral integrity. I request you all to be united without any jealousies and distinctions and not to engender communal feelings, as we are all trying to attain swaraj and we are all soldiers of one army. We shall win by our strength of spirit, by our calm courage and by our faith in freedom. Make the boycott of foreign cloth complete and effective. Do not touch a piece of foreign cloth, give work to all your workers by insisting on khadi and khadi alone. Do not wait for others to begin and other places to lead. Here, in Rajahmundry you have colleges and other institutions. You have many great men doing social service and public work. If you all join hands and work unitedly, I have no doubt that we would achieve our goal early.",

      "fullContent": "{1} March 16, 1931 I knew that there were Communists in India, but I had not met them outside the Meerut Jail, nor even heard their speeches. I made a point of interviewing the Meerut prisoners two years ago during my tour in the U.P. and thus managed to know them somewhat. I have heard one of them this evening, and I may tell them that such as they claim to win swaraj for the working men, I have my doubts about their ability to do so. I had made the working men’s cause my own long before any of the young Communists here were born. I spent the best part of my time in South Africa working for them, I used to live with them, and shared their joys and sorrows. You must therefore understand why I claim to speak for labour. I expect at least courtesy from you if nothing else. I invite you to come to me and discuss things with me as frankly as you can. You claim to be Communists, but you do not seem to live the life of communism. I may tell you that I am trying my best to live up to the ideal of communism in the best sense of the term. And communism does not, I fancy, exclude courtesy. I am amongst you today, within a few minutes I will leave you. But if you want to carry the country with you, you ought to be able to react on it by reasoning with it. You cannot do so by coercion. You may deal destruction to bring the country round to your view. But how many will you destroy? Not tens of millions. You may kill a few thousands if you had millions with you. But today you are no more than a handful. I ask you to convert the Congress if you can and to take charge of it. But you cannot do so by bidding goodbye to the elementary rules of courtesy. And there is no reason why you should be lacking in ordinary courtesy, when it is open to you to give the fullest vent to your views, when India is tolerant enough to listen patiently to anyone who can talk coherently. The truce has done no harm to the labourers. I claim that none of my activities has ever harmed the workers, can ever harm them. If the Congress sends its representatives to the Conference, they will press for no swaraj other than the swaraj for workers and peasants. Long before the Communist Party came into existence the Congress had decided that that swaraj would have no meaning which was not the swaraj for workers and peasants. Perhaps, none of you workers here gets less than a monthly wage of Rs. 20, but, I am working for winning swaraj not only for you but for those toiling and unemployed millions who do not get even a square meal a day and have to scratch along with a piece of stale roti and a pinch of salt. But I do not want to deceive you, I must warn you that I do not bear any ill to the capitalists, I can think of doing them no harm. But I want{2}, by means of suffering, to awaken them to their sense of duty, I want to melt their hearts and get them to render justice to their less fortunate brethren. They are human beings, and my appeal to them will not go in vain. The history of Japan reveals many an instance of self-sacrificing capitalists. During the last satyagraha, quite a number of capitalists went in for considerable sacrifice, went to jail and suffered. Do you want to estrange them? Don’t you want them to work with you for the common end? You have asked me about the Meerut prisoners. I want you to know that I would release every convict from our prisons, if I had the power. But I could not in justice make their release a condition prece- dent for the settlement. I may tell you that I am striving my utmost to get them released, and if only you will decide to cooperate with me by creating a calm atmosphere we may be able to get all of them released, including even the Garhwalis.Youare talkingof independence. Do not I want it as much as you? (Cries of “substance of independence”.) Yes, I want substance and not shadow. For the present, I want you to cultivate a little patience and see what the Congress puts forward as its minimum when the time comes. I assure you we will repeat the Lahore resolution at Karachi and if we chance to go to the Round Table Conference we will either return with what we want or with nothing at all. ‘What about the eleven points?’ you have asked me. They contain the substance of independence to my mind. Peasants and working men are well protected under them. But I could not repeat the points at the time of the settlement for the simple reason that they were submitted as an alternative to the launching of civil disobedience. We have now been through civil disobedience and if we are invited we have to go to the Round Table Conference to press our national demand. If we succeed there all the eleven points are secured. You may be sure that no swaraj which does not satisfy the eleven points can be acceptable to me. God has given you intellect and talent. Turn them to proper account. I beseech you not to lay an embargo on your reason. God help you.",

      "fullContent": ". . . The Ottoman Cricket Club organized a function on Saturday night at the same place . About 200 to 300 persons were present. Mr. Gandhi was requested to take the chair and he said: I came here to honour the Haj Pilgrims. I had no intention of presiding over this function. However, two of the office-bearers of the Club urged me to take the chair. I gladly complied after they had promised, in return, to join in the satyagraha movement if it were started again. It has indeed become my sole occupation to seek out people willing to go to goal for the country’s sake. I wish the mem- bers of this club, too, would equip themselves to become satyagrahis and be ready to go to goal when the occasion arises. Why should we fight shy of goal? Students of the school attached to Tolstoy Farm walked to Wightrust seven miles away. On the way, they came upon streams and bathed in them. When they were arrested , they admitted to having done wrong. On being told that they could be sent to gaol, they said that they would prefer going to gaol to being let off. At this, the authorities responsible for arresting them released them. The point is that, instead of being afraid of gaol, we should become courageous and learn to fight in defence of truth. This kind of education is necessary for the Indian community. Mr. Gandhi then expressed his heart-left happiness at having been able to attend this function to bid farewell to Mr. Dawad Mahomed and other pilgrims and then commenced the business of the meeting. In his concluding remarks as chairman, he said: I offer my hearty congratulations to Dawad Mahomed, Mahomed Coovadia{1} Dawad Seedat and Moola on their Undertakin the Haj pilgrimage. As a Hindu I am glad of their decision to go on the pilgrimage. A true Muslim cannot do Hindus harm. A true Hindu cannot do harm Muslims. Those who are capable of harming their won Indian brethren are neither true Muslims nor true Hindus. I consider any selfless work done in the service of the community as a religious and not a worldly act. I accordingly believe the services rendered by Mr. Dawad Mahomed by going to gaol{2} will be acknow- ledged in the court of God. On the other hand, I believe that and ostensibly religious act is not a godly one if not done with a pure heart. Secondly, it is repeatedly asserted that there is no unity among Indians.{3} But one should not believe that this is really so. At the same time we should not shut our eyes to the disunity among us and say that there is none. In any case it should be remembered that the cause of our sufferings in South Africa in no disunity but lack of courage. I do not wish to say that we are wholly wanting in courage. When the Imam Saheb came forward to court imprisonment, who could have predicted that he would be able to bear up with gaol? His offer to go to gaol was a courageous act and it was again due to his courage that he could remain steadfast till the end. Our chief need is to be truthful. Our motto should be Truth and nothing but the Truth. With the aid to Truth we shall be able to cross even oceans of misery. No action undertaken with a sincere motive ever goes unrewarded. Therefore, work for the community with purity of motive. It is not difficult to preserve unity. As long as the Muslims do not want to quarrel, Hindus by themselves cannot do so. If the Hindus are not spoiling for a fight, Muslims alone cannot bring about one. Even if there are a hundred people out to create dissensions as against one who comes forward to promote unity, the hundred will lose and the one will win. If that were not so, God’s divinity would be at an end. Indian Opinion, 13-7-1912",

      "fullContent": "A full translation of the speech delivered by Mr. Smuts in Pretoria appears in our Johannesburg newsletter. It deserves careful reading and attention. Mr. Smuts has spoken in his pride, but God does not allow a man’s pride to last long. The same thing will probably happen to Mr. Smuts’ pride. The arrogance of this gentleman can be equalled only by his ignorance. We are happy to note that Mr. Essop Mia has already sent a fitting reply to this gentleman. Mr. Smuts speaks as if the British Government counts for nothing with him. It is also likely that the Liberal Party might go against him as a result of such speeches. It is immaterial to us whether or not that Party opposes him. Let us take some instances of Mr. Smuts’ ignorance. He says that it is only against finger-prints that we are fighting. This is absolutely absurd. Though finger-prints is one of the questions, our struggle is not based on that question. The chief reason for the fight is that the law stamps us as criminals and liars, and attacks our community and humiliates us in the eyes of the whites and the Coloured peoples and wants to crush us as if we are altogether worthless. Ignoring all these considerations, Mr. Smuts lays stress only upon the question of finger-prints and so makes fun of us to amuse the white people. Mr. Essop Mia has already sent him a stinging reply to these lies and to the other accusations. It is a grave charge that he makes when he says that there are places in Johannesburg, Bombay and Durban where permits are fraudulently duplicated. But Mr. Smuts’ views deserve more attention than his falsehoods. From what Mr. Smuts says, it can be seen that his whole attack is on businessmen. The Indian businessman has become the special object of his dislike. He openly says that he will send the businessmen to the Location. At any cost, he wants to reserve the Transvaal exclusively for the whites. He blames the present slump on the Indian businessman. And he will not rest so long as he does not uproot him. He thinks that if we accept the law, he will be able to do whatever he likes. If after starting a big struggle and taking oaths, we go to sleep, it will be quite easy to give us kicks. The Indian businessmen must especially realize from this that, if they get registered, they will suffer a double loss. They will lose face, they will be condemned by Indians and even after soiling their hands and faces, they will have to go to the Locations and be ruined. If they remain firm and fight, their prestige will be maintained. Prestige alone is real money; not only that, there is every possibility that by remaining firm we may win the fight. That means, their business will be saved. There is only one way of saving ourselves, and that is to fight against the law. Otherwise, we are as good as dead from this very moment. Besides, we take Mr. Smuts’ speech to be merely a form of threat. The man of action does not speak much. Barking dogs seldom bite. The hooded serpent does not bite, but only hisses. On the one hand, Mr. Smuts says that every Indian will be deported in December; on the other hand, that in January licences will be cancelled and the stores closed down. What is the truth ? If all are to be driven out in December, then whose shops will be closed down? Such words are spoken only by a man mad with rage. Moreover, the authority to deport is not yet given to him. He has started holding out threats of deportation even before that. We take this to be merely a children’s play. Finally, how can the man who holds his good name dear to himself fear deportation or imprisonment? The Indian community, which has placed its trust in God, is not likely to be afraid of a thousand Smutses. Mr. Smuts goes on repeating the same thing; on the other hand, we see that in England our strength is increasing. It is learnt from the telegrams received on Tuesday that the Aborigines Protection Society and the Union of Ethical Societies have passed a joint resolution saying that the Asiatic Act is bad, and that therefore the Indian Government, the Colonial Office and the Transvaal Government ought to be considerate. All these associations and the newspapers of the world are with us. In view of this, whatever his strength and whatever his pride, what can Mr. Smuts do? Where is the man who can do any harm to those whom God protects?",

      "fullContent": "{1} Do you know that from today you{2} have become dwijas? What does the word dwija mean? It means twice-born. Today you have taken a new birth, so you have acquired knowledge today of which you were ignorant so far. The shastri has told you that you are now worthy of studying the Vedas. That, of course, you will do, but the fuller meaning of “studying of the Vedas” is a life in conformity with dharma. So far your life was devoid of the consciousness of dharma and adharma but now you have acquired that consciousness. During a famine, the sage Vishwamitra stole meat out of hunger. Having done that, he had to perform many ceremonies before eating it. No meal can be taken without taking a bath and performing the sandhya. Hence he began these ceremonies. But, while in the middle of these activities, he realized how low he had fallen! He had committed theft merely to appease his stomach, and that too of meat. He who was satisfied with fruit and vegetables and had reached the vanaprastha stage of his life had coveted meat!These thoughts made him aware of his dharma. He took the piece of meat back to the butcher from whom he had stolen it and begged forgiveness. The latter was embarrassed at the sage seeking his forgiveness and said, “King among sages, this shop is yours, satisfy your hunger as much as you wish.” This made a deep impression on the sage. He told the butcher that as from that day the latter was his guru. There follows a long conversation between the two which is narrated in the Mahabharata. However, it is irrelevant for your purpose. I narrated this story to you so that you would get an idea of what religious life is like. You have already taken a vow to keep your thoughts pure for twelve years and study while observing brahmacharya, but as from today you have begun thinking from the standpoint of dharma. You should not make the mistakes you have been making in the past as you have a new birth now. And, before you do anything you shall ask yourself whether what you are doing is right or wrong. The sacred thread is useful from this standpoint. Otherwise, there is no need to believe that dwija means a Brahmin. A Brahmin is one who has awareness of Brahman. If, after receiving the sacred thread, we do not take a new birth, if we do not begin a life in accordance with dharma, it makes little difference whether we wear it or not. I do not ask anyone to wear the sacred thread, as it has become a mere outward ceremony. But those who wish to imbibe consciousness of dharma from the ceremony may well wear the sacred thread.",

      "fullContent": "GULZARBAGH, May 16, 1947 Gandhiji referred to his visit to the refugee camp{1} nearby prior to the prayer meeting. He had not been able to see it as thoroughly as he would have liked to do. But what he saw and heard from the Superintendent made him really glad. The camp was being run on the principle of self-help. Men worked and were paid their due. The children also worked, though they were paid more than what they would be otherwise entitled to. Such self-help bred self-respect. They were innocent men and women, who had suffered at the hands of the Hindus who had gone temporarily insane. It was their duty, therefore, to make all the amends they could. They should go and visit the refugees in the camp, interest themselves in every detail of their lives, and seek to help them in every way they could. If they did that, Gandhiji said, it would be in part payment of the debt that they owed to the wronged refugees. Similarly, they need not beg the refugees who had left the province through fear or due to false propaganda, to come back. They should win them back by the magnetic power of their love. If they could create such an atmosphere of affection and brotherliness most of the Muslims who had left the province would return. His work and that of the Government would be considerably lightened. And Bihar would truly become ‘vihar’ (a garden), as its name signified.",

      "fullContent": "NEW DELHI, December 19, 1947 BROTHERS AND SISTERS, Today I had to go to Gurgaon to see the Meos. The Meos there consist of refugees from Alwar and Bharatpur, besides those who are natives of the place. The East Punjab Premier Dr. Gopichand Bhargava accompanied me. He told the Meos that those of them who wanted to stay could stay on. The Government would protect them. That hundreds of thousands had to leave their houses and properties in Pakistan was something barbarous. It was also a barbarous thing that people had to leave their houses and properties here. One cannot go into who committed more barbarities because such a discussion cannot end the enmity that has been generated. It should not be our fate to be eternal enemies of each other. It will only end in our ruin. I have said that I cannot tolerate this. Those who have made up their minds to go will certainly go but no one will be forced to go. There are men and women there in large numbers. All of them are in distress. Many of them have not even tents to shelter them and the days are so cold. It is a tragic sight. The Alwar State should admit its mistake and invite them back. The Bharatpur State should do the same. One cannot say that Meos are a criminal tribe. Who can say who is criminal and who is not? And will you exile those who are criminals? Will you kill them? This will never do. You have to reform them and educate them and show them the ways of civilized behaviour. My second topic today is sugar. Sugar is not produced everywhere. It has to be transported from the places where it is produced. If we do not have sugar here we have to bring it from the U. P. or Coimbatore, but how to do it? It can only be brought in railway wagons, but there are no wagons available. Dr. John Matthai who is in charge of the Railways is helpless. He says all the wagons are already in use and are being fully utilized. Then there is a shortage of coal and iron and of staff. Also the producers of sugar keep on raising prices and after all it cannot be carried on one’s head. But though there is a shortage of railway wagons there is motor transport. A motor-truck runs as fast as a train and it does not require steel rails on which to ply. But motor transport requires petrol and petrol is still a controlled article. If the control over petrol is lifted the trucks and lorries will start plying more easily and haul goods from one place to another. The movement of salt can also become more smooth. It is paradoxical that we produce so much salt and there is no tax on it any more, and yet it is so costly. That is because supplies do not arrive. In my view it has been a mistake to appoint contractors for producing and supplying salt. If petrol is decontrolled trucks can be used for carrying salt and several other things. It does not seem right to decontrol certain articles and continue control over others. When we have adopted decontrol as a policy we must pursue it fully and see what happens. You cannot say there is no petrol in the market. Black-market is flourishing in petrol and it will continue to flourish so long as the control over it is not lifted. I am told that corruption has also increased, that it is necessary to grease the palm of the petroleum officer and it is not a question of a rupee or two but of hundreds of rupees. Petrol is required only by those who run motor transport. The Government should retain what petrol it needs for itself and release the rest to be sold in the open market. Of course even if petrol should become virtually extinct and trains should become immobilized, the country’s affairs will not stop. Only the mode of transport will be changed. We will revert to old ways. I have therefore no fears from the control over petrol being lifted. We do not produce enough foodgrain for ourselves. We may tell people to cultivate whatever land they have but for this one is told that fertilizers are required for the import of which we have to spend crores of rupees. The fertilizers cause erosion of the soil. This is not what I say. It is what those who know the subject say. Mirabehn has been doing this work. She convened a conference of experts.{1} Some very important people were with her in this. There was Rajendra Babu and Sir Datar Singh and various others who know something about the subject. The conclusions of the Conference are in the newspapers. It recommended ways to make compost and what is called organic manure. We have dung in plenty; then there is also human faeces which can make very good manure. After it is converted into compost nobody can say how it was made. If you take it in hand it has a pleasant smell, not an unpleasant one. In making compost they also mix grass, leaves and other farmyard waste with the dung and in time it is converted into very good manure. The Conference also passed many resolutions but the substance was that we should all work hard at agriculture and grow four maunds where only one maund grew before. Mirabehn has left today. She lives in Rishikesh near Hardwar. She intends to carry on this work there. I thought I would tell you about this so that you can make what use you can of the information.",

He has now gone away from here. Where should I keep them now?’ He is a gentleman and that is why he is asking what he should do with those things. He is right. Since that man has gone away, should we appropriate those things to ourselves? But I do not have any arrangement for keeping them. This matter concerns the Home Department. The Sardar should have been consulted. Or the matter should have been referred to anyone who is handling it. Or Neogy Saheb{1} who has been appointed for the purpose should be consulted. If he can find the whereabouts of that Muslim gentleman, these things or their worth in money will have to be sent to him. A few young men from the Aligarh University came to me. Some students from West Punjab and North-West Frontier Province also study in that University. They could not reach the University and those who are here cannot leave the place. Why should they not be able to move freely? Now that Pakistan has been formed, does it mean that the Muslims should go there and the Hindus and the Sikhs should come here? The students wish to collect the blankets, etc., from Muslims and distribute them among Hindu and Sikh refugees who are facing hardships in the camps. Their intention is good and the refugees need them too. If they receive these things, it would also be an expression of love from Muslims. But really speaking, they should go to Pakistan and ask the Muslims why the Hindus and the Sikhs have to leave their homes at all. I have with me a whole pile of papers full of complaints. Those complaints are not unfounded. Of course I do feel that some exaggeration is quite possible in them. But even if there is exaggeration, there is substantial ground for those complaints. Why should the Hindus run away from their places? Call them back. Why should they not come and live in their own places? If the students are able to do this we can show to the whole world that we had never indulged in mutual fighting. Then we shall regain our honour which is sullied today. This is what I have told those boys. They have agreed to what I have said. God alone knows what they are going to do later on. But what I want to tell you today is something very important. I think that while I was in Bihar people used to think that since they had won freedom there was no need to buy tickets for travelling by train. Not only this. They sometimes indulged in acts of high-handedness and coercion. People did not indulge in mutual fighting in those days, but now they think that having won their freedom they need nothing more. I wrote quite a bit on the subject and it did have some effect and such practices were given up. But now for the past few days the situation has so developed that all over the country people have started travelling without tickets. Even well-to-do people have started thinking that they have become the owners of the trains. The railways certainly belong to us now; but the practice of ticketless travelling has resulted in a loss of Rs. 8 crores. And Rs. 8 crores is no small sum. Even Rs. 1 crore is no small sum. How difficult it was and how many people had to go round when we had to collect Rs. 1 crore for the Congress! I too went round from house to house with the others to collect the funds. With great difficulty we were able to collect that amount. The people of our country are so poor. Today we spend a crore of rupees in no time. If we get it we don’t even notice how it is spent. We still do not know how to spend. We spend just because we have been put in charge of the work. If people start having free rides in trains or do not buy tickets when travelling in connection with work, it is a kind of violence. In my view it is plain robbery. At this rate India will be reduced to utter poverty and we shall be left without railways or anything else. Then we shall feel sorry wondering how we can travel. Eight crore rupees do not make a small sum after all. In former days the railways could earn interest on their capital out of their earnings. Millions of people travel by trains. If everybody pays his fare the railways can earn quite a lot. There used to be ticketless travellers even in those days; but not in thousands as today. There used to be inspectors on the trains and the accounts used to be properly kept. But now the situation is such that the guards and the drivers are attacked. Expenditure is going up day by day. Trains cannot be run for charity. The railway employees cannot agree to forgo their salaries because the passengers do not pay their fares. What will they eat if they do not have their salaries? Thus the expenditure on railways is millions and it also earns millions. The railways incurred no loss in former days. Earnings from third-class passengers used to be considerable, because the expenditure on them used to be little. But I was pained to hear yesterday about the loss of Rs. 8 crores. Nothing good can come to us if there is going to be such looting all sides. On top of this we indulge in mutual fighting and killing and plundering. These things do no good to anyone and result in loss of crores of rupees. When people are asked to leave their homes and go away to Pakistan, they surely do not go without taking anything. They have to be fed and clothed. We have to incur all that expenditure for nothing. After all, India is not a country of the rich that it can go on spending at this rate. That is impossible. Hence even if there is a single person travelling by train, let him not travel without paying his fare. He must pay his fare. During the British days, police constables and other officials used to swallow up considerable amount of money. I know about this because I have been a third-class traveller. In those days when I had gone to Hardwar{2} for the Kumbh Mela, I found that nobody could get there without paying some extra money to the station master. In this way, thousands of rupees went by way of bribes. Now I feel that everybody has become quite honest. The station masters, signalmen, inspectors, guards, etc., should take only their legitimate dues and live only by that. They should not grab money from people. The passengers should consider the railways as their own property. They should keep the trains clean. They should not spit and smoke in the trains and should not pull the chain without real need. And not a single passenger should travel without ticket. Then I would be able to say that we have attained true independence. Here there are not thousands of people to hear me, and so who would carry my words to those hundreds of thousands of people who travel by trains? Had I been a railway manager or a railway minister I would have given orders to people working under me to tell the passengers that though they would not be physically manhandled, the railways belonged to them and the railway officials were their servants, they would not be permitted to travel without paying the fares. Even if the train is passing through a forest, the railway authorities would stop the train right there. If the passengers still did not come round they would order the driver to detach the engine from the train and drive it away. Then there would be no occasion for abusing people or using force against them; the train just would not move till the passengers paid the fare. This method should be followed as long as the passengers travel without tickets. After all, it is not proper to board the train without tickets, to indulge in violence and stop the train just anywhere one likes. What I have told you is happening in India. But I have heard that in Pakistan too people travel in trains without tickets just as here. And why should they not do so? After all we were all born in the same environment, have eaten the same salt, then why should not the same things happen there as here? But if things continue in this manner, both the countries will go bankrupt. If we travel by train without buying tickets, take bribes wherever we can and go on beating up people, we will end up as robbers. The respect we have acquired by becoming independent will be completely lost. Hence let as many people as possible and the Minister listen to what I am saying, because I am saying as an experienced man, that if this trend does not stop you will have to stop running the trains. The trains will not move and in the trains that move no passenger will be allowed to travel without paying his fare.",

      "fullContent": "{1} GANDHI CAMP PATNA , April 20, 1947 I give more importance to cultural education than to knowledge of the three R’s. Good cultural background should be evident from the minutest detail of children’s daily behaviour—from the way they sit, talk and dress, and so on. I go a step further. In a poor country not a single pie should be spent unnecessarily, otherwise no distinction would be felt between our Government and the British Government.{2} Even a foreign pin should not be used in our offices. If we need pins we should use Indian pins, or else do without them, i.e., we should stitch papers together with needle and thread. This is only by way of an illustration. I go even to the extent of saying that Ministers and Governors should take a vow along with their oath of allegiance that they will insist on only swadeshi goods being used for their personal and office requirements. But who listens to me today? Maybe I am growing old and perhaps even senile. (Bapu laughed heartily.) If I were the Chief Minister of Bihar, my first act would be to make the wearing of khadi compulsory for all Government servants and the people at large, not by purchasing it from the khadi shops but by making it a rule that no ration-card holder would be entitled to draw his ration unless he span for half an hour daily. It was clear to him, he said, that if they all learnt to spin and to weave, India could not only become self-sufficient in the matter of cloth without dependence upon mills but could even clothe the world. It was simple arithmetic. And if knowing all that, they could not get even that much done, what were the Ministers good for and what was their statecraft worth? He was afraid, they had developed the habit of making simple things which admitted of very simple solutions unnecessarily difficult and complicated. What they needed was not costly and elaborate machinery or highly paid technicians and experts, but plain common sense, combined with the will to go down to the masses, share their lives, think in their terms and win their confidence. They should teach them by personal example how they could in the immediate present provide themselves with what they so sorely needed but had hitherto lacked. The masses would instinctively feel that the era of the common man had arrived.",

He dwelt upon some of the happenings revealed in that report, and said the women of Bombay might perhaps wonder and enquire what he was trying to talk about for they might argue that here in Bombay they could move about with perfect freedom but those who argued in that fashion lost sight of this, that things which had come to pass in the Punjab might happen in Bombay provided circumstances became identical. Besides their duty should not be confined merely to preservation of their own safety but taking a broader view of it, they should try to ensure the safety of others as well. They should feel the wrongs done to their sisters and brothers of the Punjab as if they themselves had been subjected to those wrongs, and it was their duty to protest with all the emphasis at their command, so that a repetition of the Punjab atrocities might be rendered impossible either in that Province or any other part of India. If they wished to maintain their pride in India’s supreme civilization they would have to show to the world that the soul-power of India’s womanhood was greater than the physical strength of those officials who had perpetrated the atrocities in the Punjab. They must stand by the side of their husbands, brothers and sons and insist on their getting the punjab wrongs redressed. The Bombay Chronicle, 8-7-1920",

      "fullContent": "EXHIBITION{1} MALIKANDA, February 20, 1940 If you remain quiet, my voice will reach you. I just now heard some people shouting “Down with Gandhism”. Those who want to put down Gandhism have every right to say so. Those who have come to hear me will please keep quiet and not get excited by hostile slogans nor shout counter-slogans of “Gandhijiki Jai”. If you are non-violent, you should calmly tolerate such slogans. If there is any trace of untruth in Gandhism, it must perish. If it contains truth, lakhs and crores of voices clamouring for its destruction will not destroy it. Allow freedom to those who want to say anything against Gandhism. That will cause no harm. Do not bear any grudge or malice against them. You cannot realize ahimsa unless you can calmly tolerate your opponents. In truth, I myself do not know what Gandhism means. I have not given anything new to the country. I have only given a new form to the traditional of India. It would therefore be wrong to call it Gandhism. We have not assembled here for any political activity. We have come here to devise ways and means for fulfilling the principal objective of the Gandhi Seva Sangh. I cordially invite those who shouted hostile slogans to say whatever they like and give vent to their views. Why should we look upon each other as enemies ? What if our views differ ? We should remain friends because we all love India and want her to be free. One party follows one path and another party prefers a different path; but our goal remains the same. Why then should there be any enmity ? You have gathered here in such large numbers; but you remained orderly and disciplined to allow me to get here. I hope your discipline will set the model for others. If we do not cultivate discipline, we cannot attain swaraj for the millions. Now I declare the Exhibition open. I have not yet seen it myself. It would have been right and proper for me to have seen it first. The exhibits here have a special message. The Exhibition will remind you of industries the revival of which will enrich India. These days man takes pride in inert and lifeless machines. It is, however, my conviction that man is the most exquisite machine. Is there any machine in the world more miraculous and more minutely made than man ? God is its Maker. Manmade machines are lifeless. I do not understand why people should take pride in such machines. Man, the machine, is unique because it throbs with life. The ten fingers and two hands of man, with the brain he possesses, can work wonders beyond the ken of machines. I want every man and woman from every part of India to realize what art and skill are hidden in their heads and hands. God has gifted us with hands not for fighting amongst ourselves. He has given them so that we may serve and help one another. He has given us brains so that we may use our hands to create things useful for each other. Those who use their hands and heads for this purpose can alone pursue peace. They can give a good account of their time to God. With these words, I declare the Exhibition open. I hope thousands of you will visit the Exhibition and benefit from it.",

      "fullContent": "{1} May 27, 1947 The very idea of partitioning the country is frightening. Our concern today should be to bring about an agreement in a peaceful manner to ensure that the country is not partitioned and still the British leave. Even partition may be tolerated, but I cannot bear the thought that it should be imposed by the British. Why should a third party intervene in a dispute between us brothers? Are we not strong enough even to solve our own problems? It is this which makes me feel that our ahimsa was not the ahimsa of the strong but something else. But God has opened my eyes today. If we invite the British to act as intermediaries in the dispute between us brothers, it will be a great blot on our glorious history. That is why I declared in a prayer speech that, if we could not live together, we could certainly separate through mutual agreement, but that third-party intervention should not be tolerated. This is what I am going to tell the Viceroy today. This Viceroy is a very intelligent man. He will displease no party and still have his own way. This is, therefore, going to be a test for us all. Don’t forget that Lord Mountbatten is taking measure of our courage and intelligence. As the saying is, a known enemy is better than an unknown friend. Lord Linlithgow or Lord Wavell were not dangerous to us, for we knew what their policy was. I appreciate your desire to bring about equality of living standards in society. I want the same thing. But our first concern should be to come together, think what is in the best interest of the country and set the people to constructive work. Our people have lived in slavery for 150 years and need to be trained for a different way of life now. I do not fully agree with the idea that it will happen when we have power in our hands or that we can do a great deal through power. No doubt transfer of power will remove many obstacles. But we shall have to do solid work among the people. Since you look upon me as an adviser and seek my advice of your own free will, I have only one advice to give, and that is that, if you wish to establish socialism, there is only one way in which it can be done : go and live among the poor in the villages, live as they live, be one with the village people, work for eight hours daily, use only village-made goods and articles even in your personal lives, remove illiteracy among the village people, eradicate untouchability and uplift the women. I will even go so far as to suggest that you should establish such a living bond with the village people that, if anyone amongst you is unmarried and wishes to marry, he or she should choose a partner from among the village girls or boys. It anybody else seeks your advice on this subject, give him or her, too, the same advice. Make your life an ideal one in this way; when the people see your transparent lives every minute of the day as clearly as we see pictures on a screen, their influence will be felt throu-ghout the country and reform its life. The Congress will soon have power in its hands, but the Congress is not wedded to an exclusive doctrine and does not belong to any one party. Tolerance for all points of view still remains its principle. It is true that the principle is occasionally violated in practice, but even while making this admission I can assure you that if you workers can draw up a programme for village uplift and if the progra-mme does not remain merely on paper but is actively implemented, then the Congress may be in power but the Congress Ministers will assuredly help you in your real solid work. Jawaharlal will even congratulate you with all his heart. I am, however, pained to say that, instead of doing such constructive work, what you are doing today is to incite the people and call for strikes. And at the same time there is communal fighting going on. All of you are men of intellect and learning. Why can’t you see who is being harmed by what you are doing? Such a struggle was all right against the British, for we wanted them to go. But whom do you wish to drive out now? What will you gain by fighting against our own countrymen? You should be large-hearted and offer your co-operation for the great work of national uplift. If those in power commit mistakes, oppose them through your work, not by mere criticism or speeches or agita- tions. Take the village people and slum-dwellers in your hands and give them the benefit of your knowledge, skill, insight, constructive work and patriotic spirit. Give the people this true education through the example of your own lives. Let all your activities be directed to the welfare of the people. If that is not done and if the people lose patience, our plight will be much worse than the present slavery. Before the people take to the path of destruction, see that they are given constructive, life-giving training. I make this suggestion not to you alone. I have opened out my heart to you because you have come to seek my advice. But what I have said applies to Congressmen, too. Let, therefore, all public workers and all officers of the Government forget their quarrels and disputes over ideologies and start learning and teaching spinning, khadi work and village industries. If the British leave and at the same time the people are given a new life through such education, I am confident that in five years India will be a leading country in Asia. Q. Why do you oppose the growth of industries in our country through machinery? A. You can use machines to manufacture cars, engines, aeroplanes and things of that kind. But I am strongly opposed to the use of machines for grinding corn, manufacturing cloth and ploug- hing the land. The consumption of mill-ground flour has deprived us of all vitality, for machine-grinding destroys all the vitamins. In the old days in Kathiawar we didn’t have even water-taps. The women used to fetch water from the river,with shining pots resting on supports studded with bright beads; it would be early morning and the women thus had a sun-bath daily and that kept them healthy. They used to grind the corn in the early dawn, singing bhajans the while, including prayers to God. These simple innocent songs contai-ning useful moral wisdom taught them some music and provided them exercise. Afterwards the whole family would go to work in the fields, so that hardly anybody knew what illnes was or even the names of the diseases of lungs so widespread these days. In such a vast country, or say, rather, a family, containing a variety of communities and races, there is no need for machinery at all. Mach-inery does the work in very little time and that is harmful in every way, physically and economically. With so much leisure on hand, the people get busy in mischief, for, as the saying is, an idle mind is the devil’s workshop. Or they waste their time in cinemas and theatres. Many people argue with me and try to convince me that the cinema has an educative value. But the argument doesn’t appeal to me at all. For one thing, sitting in a closed theatre one feels suffocated. I had been to such a theatre only once, when I was a small child. If I had my way, I would see to it that all the cinemas and theatres in India were converted into spinning halls and factories for handicrafts of all kinds. And what obscene photographs of actors and actresses are displayed in the newspapers by way of advertisement! Moreover, who are these actors and actresses if not our own brothers and sisters. We waste our money and ruin our culture at the same time. If I was made Prime Minister of the country, these would be the first things I would do : I would stop all machine- driven flour-mills and restrict the number of oil-pressing factories but install the indigenous mills all over the country. I might not destroy the existing textile mills, but certainly would not help them in any way and, in any case, would not permit new ones to be set up. I would close all the cinemas and theatres, though I might, as an exception, permit exhibition of pictures of educational value or showing scenes of natural beauty. But singing and dancing I would stop completely. I have great regard for dancing and music. I love music indeed. I may even claim that I understand what is good music and what is not. But I would surely prohibit music and dancing which tend to pervert the minds of young men and women. I would stop the sale of gramophone records. That is, I would suggest to the Government that it should impose heavy taxes on all such life-killing activities. Similarly, harmful drinks and drugs like liqours, tobacco and tea also should be heavily taxed so that their consumption would automat- ically decrease. Moreover, ideal villages which are self-reliant in regard to food, which have not a single flour-mill and in which the residents grow all the cotton they need and manufacture their own cloth, right up to the stage of stitching gram-ents in their own homes, should be awarded prizes and exempted from all taxes. In such and ideal village, every resident will be his own policeman, his own doctor and his own watchman, and the people will have no time then to quarrel and fight among themselves. See, I have given you so much time. What I have described is only my dream of a free India, and idle dream like Sheikhchalli’s{2}. My heart was full and I, therefore, poured it out to you. At present, however, I see no sign of any of the things I have suggested being implemented. I know this and still I cannot keep back my thoughts, and so when people like you come I pour them out. Q. But, Bapu, who would oppose the suggestion to make you Prime Minister? If you agree to accept the responsibility, I don’t think anybody would oppose the proposal. A.You are the chief opponents. You will ask me why. Well, if you but act as I have advised, my dream would no longer remain a dream but become a reality. You will have economic equality in the country only along the road I have pointed out. Perhaps you will not understand this today; but note my words and remember them when I am dead and you will say that what this old man of seventy-five said was true. This is not a prophecy I am making; I am saying this on the basis of my lifelong experience. A time will surely come when nobody will listen to your long speeches; nobody will even attend your meetings, for preaching sermons to the people without following those principles in your own lives does not work long in society. The people will ask you for an account of your own work, will ask you what you yourselves are doing, before they listen to you. Similarly, in regard to the problem of Hindu-Muslim unity you will succeed only to the extent that you practise it in your own conduct and put your heart in it. Till now we acted like blind men and let ourselves be led by the hand by the British. But now we have to use our own eyes and find our own path. If you don’t watch your step and walk straight ahead, you are bound to stumble and fall into pits. Now be off. I have to go and see the Viceroy.",

      "fullContent": "{1} January 30, 1921 Mr. Gandhi was requested by the people to deliver a speech. He agreed and wanted to know if they wanted to hear him in English or in Hindi and asked them to raise their hands. Many raised their hands wishing him to speak in English. He said that it pained him much that they did not understand Hindi, the language of their own country. He then asked how many of them wanted to hear him in Hindi. A good many also raised their hands in favour of Hindi. He then spoke in Hindi and asked all to learn Hindi. He began by saying that he bore great respect for late Swami Vivekananda{2}. He had studied many of his books and said that his ideals agreed in many respects with that great man. If Vivekananda were alive it would have been a great help for their national awakening. However his spirit was amongst them and that they should do their best to establish swaraj. He said that they should learn to love their country before anything else and they should be of one mind. He asked all to use swadeshi clothes and to take to charkha and give up drinking of liquor. He said that the police were reported to be oppressive. He asked the police not to do any zoolum over the ryots who were their own countrymen. He wanted to tell the police and the army to do their job but not to interfere with the work which they were doing for the country. The police were not the servants of the Government but the servants of their countrymen. He did not want them to give up their jobs but asked them to remain prepared to obey such a call which might be given to them in proper time. He also asked the audience not to seek for Government service but to try to live independent lives. He advised them to keep that idea always before their mind. He also spoke about the national school in Calcutta and said that he had funds with him for opening other schools. Records of Intelligence Branch, I.G.P., West Bengal",

      "fullContent": "POONA September 4, 1924 The education that you are receiving is intended for swaraj. I have taken up the responsibilities of a chancellor in Gujarat. That too I have done in my capacity as a fighter for freedom and with the intention of training students to be fighters for freedom. I landed in England on 4th{1} of August, 1914. What did I see there? As the War spread, the Inns of Courts went on closing. Many faculties in Oxford and Cambridge were also closed. During the War, they allotted a minor role to education. And why should they not? The outcome of education is that the student becomes an ideal citizen, an ideal patriot and an ornament to his family, his community and his nation. I had witnessed the same scene twenty-four years earlier in South Africa. College students were enrolling themselves in the army and the Red Cross; girls and boys had all left their colleges and taken up this work. I was a black man; but I saw white pleaders and barristers joining the War. I was ashamed, on entering the court, to find it deserted. I thought that I should also undertake this work. When the nation is in danger, only work to meet it needs to be done. If you recognize this point of view, then an unscholarly man like myself standing before you makes some sense; otherwise inviting me as a chief guest here would amount to pulling my leg. What should an English visitor hope to find in your institution, if he came here after visiting Government institutions? Would he see your buildings or your scholars and expect to hear them speaking English? No, he will expect to discover a new spectacle here. In the other schools, he would not have seen spinning; here he would expect to see spinning and weaving. He would want to see cotton growing in your lawns. He would like to see your yarn. If he found the yarn fine, he would say to himself that Manchester was in danger. If he found the yarn rough, he would say Manchester had no cause to be anxious. He would not expect to find you dressed like sahibs; he would expect to find you dressed like the poor. He would expect to find you speaking your own language. When General Botha{2} went to England and there had occasion to meet the king, he refused to speak in English. He insisted on speaking in Tal, a dialect of Dutch. He conversed with the king through a Tal interpreter. It was not as though he did not know English; he could speak better English than I; but he considered it an honour to speak his own tongue. President Kruger{3} also used to refuse to converse in any language except Tal. That was the way they asserted their power. I therefore expect you to speak to me in Hindi, Urdu and Marathi. There is nothing unique in your securing a teacher who can speak fluent English. It would be creditable if you have a penniless, religious-minded and self- sacrificing teacher who can impart education through Hindi or Marathi. It would not matter if he is inferior to others in scholarship. I beg from you only one thing, namely, you should recognize the scope of the university and understand precisely what it stands for.",

He would like to join the people of Kolar in wishing His Highness the Maharaja of Mysore many a return of the birthday which his subjects all over the State were celebrating with great joy. He was glad to hear that the Municipality was doing some work in the cause of the Harijans. He was also very much pleased to hear that the Municipality had many more things to do for the Harijans. Unless untouchability was blotted out, root and branch, the Hindu society would perish. Therefore, so long as untouchability remained in the land in one form or another, they could not say that they had done anything for the cause of the Harijans. Proceeding, Mahatmaji congratulated the Mysore Government on the establishment of khadi centres and appealed to the people to take to khadi. He wished he could go to other parts of India and say that in Mysore State at least, the people wore khadi and used swadeshi articles. The Hindu, 1-6-1936",

      "fullContent": "{1} BHANGI COLONY, NEW DELHI, April 8, 1947 If you are proud of your country and wish to convey that impression during your visit to another country, you should exemplify in your conduct, the innate good qualities and special features of your nation. If, therefore, you, who have come here to make a study, want to leave a good impression about your country, you will have to bear yourself accordingly. Otherwise you are liable to be misunderstood and might unknowingly be done injustice. I give the same advice to Indians living abroad. There are many good features in our country. Take for example non-violence and khadi among industries. Therefore I cry myself hoarse telling the Indians settled abroad that even if they did not ply the charkha here, it is their duty to ply it regularly there. Even if they did not wear khadi here, there they should wear it habitually. Instead, innumerable Indians have become enamoured of silks and other things available in foreign countries. The result is that the country does not gain in moral strength. They should demonstrate to the women there that we can do without brandy or cigarettes; they should tell them what an Aryan woman stands for. Addressing the woman journalist Gandhiji said: Similarly you should show here that woman occupies an important place in the world and she is not merely a plaything for men, that she is courageous too. Try to leave upon the women here an impress of your culture. I would like to make a suggestion to you which I feel would appeal to you. If you like it, you may keep it in mind and try to act accordingly, otherwise forget it. I am obliged to you even for listening to me. My suggestion is that women can play a very important role in establishing peace. Instead of being carried away by science they should follow the path of non-violence because women by nature are endowed with the quality of forgiveness. Women will never succeed in aping men in everything, nor can they develop the gift nature has bestowed on them by doing so. They should neither allow their family members to have, nor should they themselves have any connection with anything relating to war. God has endowed women with hearts overflowing with love. They should utilize this gift properly. That power is all the more effective because it is mute. I hold that God has sent women as messengers of the gospel of non-violence. Gandhiji’s fair visitor was deeply moved: “If there is anyone in the world who can point the way of deliverance to womankind, it is you . . . . We realize that what you have told us today is also the answer to the challenge of the atom bomb. . . . Why do you not visit our country?” BAPU: Yes, I would indeed like very much to visit your country. But at present I see no such prospect. If you want me to go there I would request you to help me by devoting yourself to the service of my coutnry. Try to quell the riots that are raging amongst us and help in stopping the killing of women and children. I shall certainly be free to visit your country provided you are successful in your attempt, provided a democratic government is proclaimed here and the millions of people here are as happy as you are in your country. But this is like attempting to pluck a flower from the sky.",

      "fullContent": "{1} March 24, 1925 You have very clearly set forth what my ambition at the present moment is. Eating, walking, sleeping and doing everything, I can think of nothing but the spinning of khaddar, removal of untouchability and unity of almost all classes and races. But there is a limit to our capacity for doing the work in the last two things; all cannot pay equal contribution to the removal of untouchability and all cannot also pay equal contribution to the bringing together of the different classes say, at the present day, the Hindus and Mussalmans, or, as I now discover, the non-Brahmins and Brahmins. (Laughter.) As I say, this is not one in which everyone could only assist or simply re- frain by doing anything . Therefore, it takes a negative character; whereas in spinning and khaddar the young, the old and debilitated could do their very best. A little Panchama boy could beat Mr. Prakasam hollow, if he chooses, in hand-spinning, (Laughter.) and a man in the street can give points to Mr. Srinivasa Iyengar, so far as wearing khaddar is concerned. I feel thankful, therefore, for the reassurance given to me in this address that Swarajya will not abandon this message of khaddar and of the spinning-wheel, but it will carry it to the hamlets. I do not know how it will carry it to the hamlets, because people do not read the English Swarajya. I know that is the only programme before the country which is incredibly the simplest proposition in which all could participate. But the simplest of propositions carry with them the significance of the highest order. I know, I have only this message to give at the present moment and that is our unfortunate tragic position. As I said, speaking to the girls of the college, illiteracy in India is very great and only a small percentage of our people can read and write. How can they take the message from the newspapers? Therefore, I have suggested to Mr. Prakasam at Poona that he should become a walking newspaper, and to everyone. If we talk less or talk simply of the spinning-wheel, then the message of the spinning-wheel would spread. Take the spinning-wheel, plant yourself in some place in the village and simply turn it away. The villagers and their children will take to it. I was really that all our newspapers talk about nothing but the charkha just as you know during the War and even after the War, every home in Europe talked of nothing but the War and its evils. Why may we not do the same thing, if we are convinced that there is no other living tangible programme before the country, and as far as I know, this is the only tangible programme before the country. Therefore, let this message percolate from this office to every hamlet at least in the Southern Presidency. (Loud cheers.)",

Mr. Gandhi said with Indians, non-participation in the councils was a matter of national honour and self-respect and no self-respecting Indian could participate until martial law delinquents were punished. He said the English people were a high-souled race but unfortunately they had been weaned away from the teaching of Jesus Christ by the theories of Bentham, Darwin and other materialistic writers. If Indians wanted to be partners with Englishmen, they had got to cultivate virtues of self-respect and honour, qualities which alone appealed to Englishmen and they should not be subservient weaklings. Incidentally, Mr. Gandhi said knowing as he did the agriculturists of his country and their love and attachment to home and homestead lands, he thought the consequences of non-payment of taxes might bring them into collision with the authorities. He did not therefore advise them to have recourse to non-payment of taxes which was the last stage in his programme.",

        "1": "The Gujarat Sabha advised the Kheda farmers on January 10 to refrain from paying land revenue. This was criticised by the Collector of Kheda district in a statement on January 14: “The Collector has full authority either to recover land revenue or to grant postponement, and I have issued my final orders only after a careful investigation of the crops in the district. In some villages of the district,where I felt relief was necessary, I have issued orders giving postponement of a part of the land revenue. Land holders must now, therefore, pay up their land revenue and the outstanding taqavi. If, nevertheless, anyone influenced by the wrong advice which is being given to them refuses to pay up his land revenue dues, I shall be compelled to take stringent legal measures against him.” This was followed by a statement from the Government of Bombay on January 16, which supported the Collector’s action, questioned the locus standi of the Gujarat Sabha in Ahmedabad in advising the farmers of Kheda, described the issue of such advice as “thoughtless and mischievous” and asserted that the Government would not allow “any intervention in the normal work of the collection of land revenue dues” in the “rich and fertile district”. On being telegraphically informed of this statement, Gandhiji sent this telegram to the Sabha.",

      "fullContent": "{1} I think I reported last week that we met Sir William Lee-Warner and Mr. Morison in the hotel where we are staying. They expressed their sympathy. Afterwards we met Major Syed Hussain Bilgrami. He has agreed to do his best. We also saw, through the good offices of Miss Winterbottom, a lady named Mrs. Tedman. She has married a Dutchman. Mr. Tedman works for a Dutch newspaper there and knows General Botha and others. He has promised to see General Botha. We also called on a journalist named Mr. Brown, who had been helpful during the previous deputation . The Parsi Anjuman gave a dinner in honour of one Mr. Bhedwar, a Parsi barrister, with Sir Muncherji in the chair. We were invited to attend the function. Indians made speeches on that occasion promising to help us. We, too, as also Mr. Ritch, were given an opportunity to say a few words on the subject. We had an interview with Mr. Stead, editor of the Review of Reviews. He is on good terms with General Smuts and has promised to see him. We met Mr. Gupta and Nawab Imd-ul-Mulk Syed Hussain Bilgrami, members of the India Office. We have explained the entire position to them. We had meetings with others also, but these, being unimportant, I am not reporting. As advised by Lord Ampthill, we have requested Lord Crewe and Lord Morley to fix time for interviews with them. There has been a reply from Lord Crewe, asking us to give reasons why we want to see him. We have sent a reply.{2} Whether an interview will be granted or not will be known next week. The more experience I have of meeting so-called big men or even men who are really great, the more disgusted I feel after every such meet-ing. All such efforts are no better than pounding chaff. Everyone appears preoccupied with his own affairs. Those who occupy positions of power show little inclination to do justice. Their only concern is to hold on to their positions. We have to spend a whole day in arranging for an interview with one or two persons. Write a letter to the person concerned, wait for his reply, acknowledge it and then go to his place. One may be living in the north and another in the south. Even after all this fuss, one cannot be very hopeful about the outcome. If considera-tions of justice had any appeal, we would have got long before now. The only possibility is that some concessions may be granted through fear. It can give no pleasure to a satyagrahi to have to work in such conditions. I think it will be far better to submit to still further suffering than exhaust ourselves in such efforts and waste so much money on them. If, in spite of the difficulties, our demands are conceded, I shall conclude that we had suffered enough to have earned the concessions. If they are not conceded,I shall believe that still more sacrifices are called for. I can think of no course so wonderfully effective as voluntary suffering. Even the most powerful orators cannot protest as effectively as suffering can. Suffering is bound to bring redress. Those who are pre- pared to suffer need not advertise their suffering. I believe, It will speak for itself. Accordingly. I advise every Indian to have suffering as his companion. Everything else is mere bubbles in water. Do not expect much from the deputation. Always bear in mind that there is no help like self-help, and ready for gaol. That way alone lies victory. The cables received from other towns have been forwarded to the Colonial Office and the India Office. INOPPORTUNE Everyone believes that the deputation has arrived at an inopportune time. In no more than a few days, all the important men will have left London. They take a holiday in the month of August. It is therefore difficult to undertake any public activity. The situation is awkward, to be sure, but the circumstances would not have permitted sending the deputation at some other time. It was necessary that it should have been here just when the others from South Africa were here. And the upshot of it is that, if the private moves bear no fruit, there is precious little possibility of gaining anything through public representations.",

      "fullContent": "DR. ANNIE BESANT’S DECLARATION The reader will, I hope, join me in welcoming Dr. Annie Besant’s declaration on the situation. It is to me a matter of great importance that she should recognize the necessity of spinning by way of example by every worker in the national cause. Her example must mean much for the spinning movement. That at her age the gifted lady should consent to devote half an hour in the midst of his incessant activity to spinning speaks volumes for her devotion to the national cause. So far as the constitution of the Congress is concerned, there is evidently some confusion. There is no question of suspending it. It will need amending, if my proposal about spinning is accepted. The non-co-operation programme, including civil disobedience, is not part of the constitution. That programme will, if my proposals are accepted, be certainly suspended for one year. My share in the framing of a swaraj scheme would be this. I would attend, if required, any non-official conference of different parties to frame the scheme. I would be bound by the majority vote in the sense that I would not threaten civil disobedience or non-co-operation, merely because the scheme does not satisfy me—not even after the year of grace is over— provided the majority are satisfied with it. 1 would actively work for the scheme, if it satisfies my minimum. I may here say a word about the Congress constitution. I observe critics ascribing to me the opinion that the constitution has been an absolute failure. It has certainly broken down as measured by its own standard. But in my opinion it cannot be seriously denied that the Congress still remains the most national and representative of all the organizations of India. It still has the largest number of original members on its books and has the largest number of volunteers and paid workers of any organization. Nor do I wish to be understood to mean that non-co-operation has absolutely failed. On the contrary, it has vitalized the nation as nothing else has. But it has not come up to the expectations formed of it. The response of the people was great, but not great enough for the purpose intended. All this, however, is small comfort to the workers, who have yet much work to do before they can reap the harvest. SUSPENSION OR REPEAL A friend writes:”Is not your proposed suspension of boycotts only repeal in disguise?” Not for me. I have no present intention of securing repeal of the boycotts. If I had, I should not have hesitated to say so. I hope that it may not be found necessary to resume them. But I should have not the slightest hesitation in advising resumption if I found them necessary for national growth, just as I find their suspension necessary for national growth.”Are you not postponing the internecine feud for a year?” says the friend. My answer again is,”No”. We would know at the end of the year where we stand. The boycotts certainly cannot be revived, if at the end of the year there is still a likelihood of sharp divisions. They can only become the national programme if the active workers on the political field can be persuaded of their necessity. Till that happens, they must remain a policy or a creed with a minority. We must not shut our eyes to the fact that whatever the Government yields will be yielded to the demand of the small, vocal and active section of the nation. Nothing will be yielded if this section is divided into many warring sub-sections. I should expect one of two things at the end of the year, either the No-changers will be converted to the purely political, i.e., external activity or the pure politicians will, recognizing the futility of mere external activity, devote themselves to the intensive internal development which would necessarily involve acceptance of boycotts. It may be also that the internal development as well as political activity will command far more general acceptance and, each party helping the other, we shall compel the Government to accede to the minimum joint demands of all the parties. The central idea underlying my proposal is to unite the nation on a common platform and to hope that each party, honestly acting upon the other, would be voluntarily converted to a common form of action. Even if this grand purpose fails, we may expect at least to part company with the best grace possible and without imputing motives to one another. Suspension is not an unusual state in a movement. It often brings greater strength to a suspended plan, if it has innate vitality. Those, therefore, who believe in the intrinsic merit of the boycotts need not fear their permanent disappearance because of a brief spell of suspension. They, the believers, ought to be the surest guarantee against any such catastrophe. “HEART-UNITY” A correspondent writes: In your reply to the Bombay Municipal address{1} you have used an expression—heart-unity. I pondered and meditated on it and saw that in the core of the universe is the secret of heart-unity. One has to go down far into the fathomless depths, grasp and run away with the divine touch-stone and touch with it the sundered and discoloured parts of human associations to bring back colour and happiness. It is in the inner being of Satya and Rita, of Truth and Law of Nature. It is heart-unity that binds planet to planet and holds planets aloft in space, and it is heart-unity that keeps elemental matter bound each to the other. Chemists had discovered water was a compound of hydrogen and oxygen but by bringing the two together, they could not get water till an electric current passed through them. That electric current is the heart-unity in Nature. It is heart-unity that transforms things—melts ice into water, and freezes water into ice, evolution and involution, the descent of spirit into matter and the return of matter to spirit are all the work of heart-unity. Parvati’s tapasya for heart-unity with Siva is a wonderful piece of Hindu imagery. Parvati is God’s Shakti or the active principle in the universe, incarnate in human form. I feel it was a direct vision from God to some sadhak ancestor of the race. The force of activity in the Almighty was revealed in its most beautiful aspect, in the place of matter, as Parvati engaged in tapasya— for what? for nothing less, i.e., denser than heart-unity with the Heart of Hearts—çk.kLFk çk.ka, a lesson for humanity to con and master. You have mastered it and applied it in the political field by heart-unity with the Alis and others, with the result that we are well on our way to get the compound of an Indian Nation made out of several distinct elements of various races and creeds. May the country take the cue from you and be firm in her tapasya of activity in the direction of heart-unity. I print the letter not for the compliment it pays me but for the heart-unity the writer emphasizes and truly sees in my association with the Ali Brothers and others not of the same faith or even of the same mode of thought.”What is it”, the Big Brother said to me last week,”that binds us so indissolubly together, though we are so dissimilar in most things. Is it not after all the allegiance to and the fear of the same God?” What he said was so natural and true. Why should we blaspheme God by fighting one another because we see Him through different media —the Koran, the Bible, the Talmud, the Avesta or the Gita? The same sun beats on the Himalayas as on the plains. Should the men of plains quarrel with the men of the snows because of the different feel of the sun? Why should we make of books and formulas so many fetters to enslave us rather than use them as aids to our deliverance and union of hearts? VYKOM SATYAGRAHA The Vykom Satyagraha has perhaps a meaning deeper than is generally realized. The young men who have organized it are stern in discipline and gentle in their dealings with the orthodox section. But this is the least part of their trials. Some of them are suffering too the persecution of social boycott. We, of the western presidency, have no idea of what this persecution can mean. These young men who are taking part in the movement are not only being denied social amenities but are threatened even with the deprivation of their share in the family property. If they would go to law, probably they would get their due. But a satyagrahi cannot go to law for a personal wrong. He sets out with the idea of suffering persecution. In a reform that the Vykom struggle seeks to achieve, the satyagrahi seeks to convert his opponent by sheer force of character and suffering. The purer he is and the more he suffers, the quicker the progress. He must therefore resign himself to being ex-communicated, debarred from the family privileges and deprived of his share in the family property. He must not only bear such hardships cheerfully but he must actively love his persecutors. The latter honestly believe that the reformer is doing something sinful and therefore resort to the only means they know to be effective to wean him from his supposed error. The satyagrahi on the other hand does not seek to carry out his reform by a system of punishments but by penance, self-purification and suffering. Any resentment of the persecution, therefore, would be an interruption of the course of discipline he had imposed upon himself. It may be a prolonged course, it may even seem to be never ending. A little bullying or even moral persuasion or coercion may appear more expeditious. What, however, I am showing here is not the greater efficacy of satyagraha but the implications of the method the satyagrahi has deliberately chosen for himself. Indeed I have often shown in these pages that satyagraha is, as a matter of fact and in the long run, the most expeditious course. But my purpose here is merely to show what the young satyagrahis of Vykom are doing. The public know much of what they are doing in the shape of picketing but they know nothing of the silent suffering, some of them are undergoing at the hands of their families and caste men. But I know that it is this silent and loving suffering which will finally break the wall of prejudice. I am anxious therefore that the reformers should realize their responsibility to the full and not swerve by a hair’s breadth from their self-imposed discipline. SOUTH INDIA RELIEF Hardly had Mr. George Joseph been out of jail when he made time to send a friend the following description{2} of the distress in Travancore: What another friend wrote immediately after the floods was also quite true. He said that what damage the rebellion could not do in months was done by seemingly heartless Nature in a day. The real relief will commence after the preliminary work of immediate relief is finished. The readers of Young India and Navajivan are making a most liberal response to my appeal. They may be sure that it is none too liberal for the task before the workers. I invite cotton merchants to send cotton when they cannot send cash. Thousands who cannot possibly cultivate their land for another year have nothing but the spinning-wheel to fall back upon. I am asking workers to send plans of finding employment for these distressed countrymen and countrywomen. The wheel is no fetish for me and I assure the donors that if I find another common form of work for the thousands, I will not hesitate to devote their donations to that purpose. JEALOUS OF HIS PROVINCE The secretary, A.I.K.B., has handed me for explanation and correction the following legitimate protest from Bihar: Our attention has been drawn to Mahatma Gandhi’s note in the Young India of the 4th instant regarding the yarn sent by the members of the various provinces. Regarding Bihar Mahatmaji says,”There is no second best to Sjt. Rajendra Prasad’s.” As it might mean discouragement to some of our good spinner members, I would request you to kindly re-examine the yarns of the following members and non-members. If they are found even tolerably fair, kindly see that some mention is made of them. I have omitted 17 names given in the letter. I owe the secretary and the seventeen members an apology. The fact is that I handed the original report which was in Gujarati and which is printed in full in Navajivan for a condensed translation to an assistant and published the translation without comparing it with the original which does no injustice to Bihar. This is the translation of the portion of the original referring to Bihar: “The yarns received are almost all common. Most hanks are unevenly spun. Cotton not good. Yarn not sprayed. Babu Rajendra Prasad has sent 10,148 yards. It is near 8 counts but is even and well-hanked. There is little yarn from this province so good as this.” I am sorry for the injustice done to Bihar by the Young India note referred to. I hope that I shall have the good fortune to find the defects mentioned by the examiner removed in the second month’s consignment. The examiner draws my attention to the translation of the portion relating to Sind also and says there may be a just protest from Sind. I therefore hasten to give a full translation of the report regarding Sind as follows: “Except in the case of two or three packets, there seems to be absence of practised spinning. In some packets the hanks vary and the sizes are curious. No yarn seems to have been sprayed. Some have not even taken the trouble of hanking the yarn.” Though Sind may resent it, I am inclined to pardon the translator for the following condensation.”A sorry affair. Little trace of practised spinning.” Neat Sindhis, beware !",

      "fullContent": "VAIKOM SATYAGRAHA His Holiness Sri Narayan Guru, spiritual leader of the Tiyas{1}, is reported to have disapproved of the present methods of satyagraha at Vaikom. He suggests that volunteers should advance along barricaded roads and scale the barricades. They should enter temples and sit with others to dine. Though I have compressed the interview. I have reproduced almost the exact words. Now the action proposed is not satyagraha. For scaling barri- cades is open violence. If you may scale barricades, why not break open temple doors and even pierce through temple walls? How are volunteers to pierce through a row of policemen except by using physical force? I. do not for one moment suggest that by the methods proposed the Tiyas, if they are strong and are willing to die in sufficient numbers, cannot gain their point. All I submit is that they will have gained it by something the reverse of satyagraha; and then, too, they would not have converted the orthodox to their view, but would have imposed it on them by force. A friend who has sent me the press cutting recording the interview suggests that, by reason of the violent advice of the guru, I should ask the local Congress committee to call off satyagraha. I feel that would mean want of faith in one’s means and surrender to violence. So long as the organizers strictly keep within the limits which they have prescribed for themselves, there is no cause for calling off satyagraha. The friend cites Chauri Chaura as an illustration. In doing so, he has betrayed confusion of thought or ignorance of facts. The Bardoli satyagraha was suspended because Congress and Khilafat men were implicated in the Chauri Chaura outrage. If Congressmen connected with the Vaikom movement entertain the suggestions said to be favoured by the Tiya spiritual leader, there would be a case for penance and, therefore, suspension, but not otherwise. I would, therefore, urge the organizers at Vaikom to make redoubled efforts and, at the same time, keep stricter watch on the conduct of those who take part in the movement. Whether it takes long or short to reach the goal, the way is the way of peaceful conversion of the orthodox by self-suffering and self-purification and no other. MEANING OF ‘UNTRUTHFUL’ A Swarajist friend writing from Simla about the use of the adjectives ‘violent’ and ‘untruthful’ in my recent writings says: You mean those who are ‘untrue’ to the triple boycott. May I suggest most respectfully to explain that observation, by the way, in one of your notes? As it has pained some prominent friends here, so must it have pained others elsewhere. I have understood it in the light in which I have interpreted it above. But I believe, especially when you will be the last man in the world to be misunderstood, a reference in one of your notes will not be futile Had not the friend kindly drawn my attention to the misunder- standing, I should never have known its existence. The whole of my recent writings have been directed to the untruthful atmosphere that surrounds us. My criticism is all-inclusive. I know No-changers who do not enforce in their own persons the khaddar resolution. Their action is, in my opinion, decidedly untruthful. When we do not believe in the boycott of law-courts and still pretend as if we did, our attitude is untruthful. Many of us do not believe in non-violence in thought, word, and deed, and still profess to subscribe to the policy of non- violence. We are untruthful whether we are Pro-changers or No- changers. SPECIAL SESSION? I note that Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya{2} has given notice of intention to move at the forthcoming meeting of the A.I.C.C. a resolution for a special session of the Congress. There is hardly any case for a special session. The Congress resolutions are there. There should be no difference of opinion as to their meaning. Even if there is, parties may agree to differ and set to work. All that is required is for the members to decide upon the method of work during the next six months. Policies may be determined at the Congress session. The special session will not help us to remove our indecision, indifference or inertia. I feel sure that these would persist so long as each party continues to accuse the other of retarding the progress of the country. In my opinion, nobody retards it who acts to the best of his lights. But he does retard it who is too lazy to think and act for himself, or too timid to do so lest he may give offence. We must dare to say ‘no’ even if it wounds. INFLAMMATORY LITERATURE A friend has sent me a pamphlet called Rangila Rasul, written in Urdu. The author’s name is not given. It is published by the manager, Arya Pustakalaya, Lahore. The very title is highly offensive. The contents are in keeping with the title. I cannot without giving offence to the reader’s sense of the fine give the translation of some of the extracts. I have asked myself what the motive possibly could be in writing or printing such a book except to inflame passions. Abuse and caricature of the Prophet cannot wean a Mussalman from his faith and it can do no good to a Hindu who may have doubts about his own belief. As a contribution, therefore, to the religious propaganda work, it has no value whatsoever. The harm it can do is obvious. Another friend sends me a sheet called Shaitan printed at Public Printing Press, Lahore. It contains untranslatable abuse of Mussal- mans. I am aware of similar abuse by Mussalman sheets. But that is no answer to or justification for the Hindu or the Arya Samaj abuse. I would not have even noticed these prints but for the information given to me that such writings command a fair patronage. The local leaders must find a way of stopping these publications or, at least, discrediting them and distributing clean literature instead, showing tolerance for each other’s faiths. THREE AGAINST ONE A Mussalman friend writes to say that, whilst the Bhopal State apostasy law is undoubtedly bad, the agitation against it is not genuine. He says the law is old and has never been enforced. He contends that the Hindus m that State have been most justly treated and have often occupied posts of the highest responsibility. ‘But,’ says the friend, ‘do you know what is happening in the Hindu States or Palol, Rewa and Bharatpur? Palol you mentioned yourself. In Bharatpur already three mosques have been demolished. The order of Rewa is said to be that, it a Hindu becomes a Mussalman, he will be awarded one year’s imprisonment and the man who convert him to Islam will get two years’. I, the facts are as set forth, Hindus have little reason to complain of a law that is a dead letter. Personally, I think that on the principle that two wrongs do not make one right, the wrong must be condemned wherever it exists. Wherever conversion is punishable by law, it is a token of intolerance which must be rooted out. But the first appeal of Hindus must be to the Hindu States. KENYA INDIANS The Kenya Indians are continuing their brave fight in the face of heavy odds. Messrs Goolam Hoosen Aladina, Ahmedbhai Karim, Valibhai Ismail, and Kasim Noor Mahomed, together with many others, are already in jail. And now comes the news that Mr. Desai too shares the same honours. The Kenya Indians deserve congratulations for sustaining the fight. But the law chosen for civil disobedience affects only a limited number of Indians. The penalty imposed is slight. If, therefore, our countrymen in Kenya are intent upon carrying on the struggle till justice is done to them, they will have to find other State-made unmoral laws for civil disobedience, such as will enable a larger number, if they are willing, to offer battle and to undergo a stronger course of suffering. The Kenya Committee that is now sitting in London may give them temporary relief. Public agita- tion here may encourage them. But the real remedy lies with them. They should remove every cause of legitimate complaint against them and, at the same time, by offering civil disobedience prove their courage for prolonged suffering in a common cause. Then success is a certainty. VALUE OF SILENT WORK Borodada (Dwijendranath Tagore) sends the following hopeful note: The following has come to my mind like a flash of lightning. How great a value a simple good work has when done silently before the all-seeing eye of God seems to me to be unknown to the generality of men of our present generation. Most people, who are worthy in other respects, place an undue value on the high-sounding names of things and persons, disregarding altogether their real import. Are the rishis of ancient India less of rishis because their names are unknown to the superficial histories of modern times? When will the eyes of our understanding be opened to this simple and soul-satisfying truth that mere names are words echoed from mouth to mouth signifying nothing? How many people pay homage to the name of Shakespeare without ever having opened a single book of Shakespeare? How many people bow to the name of Christ with the appearance of sincere reverence, whose daily life throws to the dogs every word of Christ spoken in love to all humanity irrespective of caste and creed? I am perfectly sure that each good work, however insignificant in appearance, will bear tenfold fruit in comparison to the grandiloquent and pompous works performed mostly with a view to acquire names in history. It is obvious that if we want to gain success in this great movement which Providence has placed in our hands without our asking, we must concentrate all our efforts on the real work we have to do, and totally cut off all connection with those names of things and persons which exert undue influence over our untutored minds and which ‘hover through the midnight air’ of our ignorance (of avidya) like the witches of Macbeth. The name of non-co-operation may shock the prejudiced ear of a student of the abstract ethics of the schools, while the thug non-co-operation is the best medicine for the cure of our mad endeavour after the attainment of all the nourishment that bread can give from the stones thrown at us in mockery by the well-fed and well-clothed house holder at whose door we stand begging, in out present half-starved and ragged condition, to be allowed the privilege of co-operating with him, on equal teams, with regard to the right distribution of food and clothing amongst us for our mutual benefit. I wish every worker will treasure the beautiful thought contained in Borodada’s note and believe with him that all true work will abide when names will have been forgotten. 1814 AND 1914 Babu Kshitish Chandra Dasgupta of the Khadi Pratishthan says that in 1814 two crores (now equal to twelve crores) of rupees worth of khadi was exported from Calcutta alone. In 1914 India imported sixty-six crores of rupees worth of piece-goods. No wonder that we have become a nation of paupers. We would not be so badly off if we had given up the spinning and the weaving industry in exchange for another. That we could not do because the national industry was deliberately killed and no other was substituted by its murderers. CHARKHA IN TRIVANDRUM JAIL Mr. K. Kumar, a satyagrahi prisoner in the Central Jai! at Trivandrum, says: This is one of the happiest days in my life being the day of my arrest and imprisonment (after one month) . . . I send you the product of the hours of silent spinning. We have the charkha working here almost from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. . . . I spin not less than three hours daily. . . . Some of us are learning Hindi or Urdu, we read the Gita. and the puranas . . . we have prayers at 6 p.m. which are attended by all without distinction of caste or creed. . . . The officials show us every consideration.",

      "fullContent": "{1} WEEKLY STATEMENT ENDING NOVEMBER 16,1903 The situation remains still the same. The summary given last week{2}may be very greatly elaborated on the strength of Lord Milner’s dispatch dated 2nd May, 1903 and addressed to Mr. Chamberlain, It was shewn last week how very little regard has been paid to the Indians, although Lord Milner states that the Government are anxious to enforce the Law in a way most considerate to the Indians already settled in the Colony. In view of the great interests which are at stake, it is necessary to pick out other passages from Lord Milner’s dispatch to shew how truly at variance it is with the practice that is being followed at present. Lord Milner says: Had we had to deal with merely the Asiatic population as it existed before the war, it might have been possible to remain passive until a new law had been formed to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government; but with so many new-comers constantly pouring in, etc. it became impossible to persist in the policy of complete inaction. His Lordship continues: As I have already stated, the Government is prepared to recognise the vested interests of Asiatics resident here before the war. On the other hand, it feels that it would not be justified in allowing new vested interests to spring up contrary to the law. During the war and since the declaration of peace, a large number of temporary trading licences were issued to new-comers. These licences have been renewed until December 31st, 1903, but holders have been warned that on that date they will be required to remove to streets or Bazaars selected for this purpose. Now, according to the above, there should be no difficulty inthe way of those who were trading before the war either with or without licences, also, with those who were settled in the country before war, whether they traded in the country before war or not. The Bazaar Notice should, according to the dispatch, affect only those new- comers who are said to have poured in. As a matter of fact, as has been pointed out in previous statements, there are very few new- comers, because only refugees have been allowed to enter the country. It would not, therefore, do to rely upon the dispatch in question and sit still. Time is quickly passing by, and it is very necessary that, in accordance with the dispatch, there should be a guarantee given to the poor British Indians that their licences would be respected. Further on, Lord Milner states: We have no wish to subject respectable British Indians, or civilised Asiatics generally, to any disabilities, and therefore, His Excellency proceeds: It is, in three most important respects, shewing a consideration for the Asiatics which the late Government did not shew. One of those respects is exemption of Asiatics of a superior class from all special legislation; this consideration has not yet been shewn, except with regard to residence, which is the least important thing; the most important part being to leave undisturbed the trade of the men who conform to the laws of the country. Much stress is undoubtedly laid on the right of residence outside Locations, but comparatively speaking, the right of residence is a matter of sentiment, the right of trade one of bread and butter. As to the selection of the Bazaar sites, there is only one opinion among the Indians, namely, that they could not have been worse chosen by their inveterate opponents; for trade they are perfectly use- less; in most cases they are vacant pieces of ground away from the business centres. Disinterested professional men have testified to their being valueless for trade. With reference to the Rustenberg Bazaar, even a member of the Health Board has not hesitated to say that trade cannot be carried on there, and yet this is what Lord Milner has said to Mr. Chamberlain: As you are aware, the sites selected by the Government of that late South African Republic for the purpose of Asiatic Bazaars were in many cases most unsuitable for such a purpose, being remote from the business centres of the town. In many towns, no site at all was selected. It is the intention of the Government to lose no time in selecting suitable sites for Asiatic Bazaars accessible to all classes of the community, and I am confident that, once the Bazaars are established and arranged in conformity with the customs and requirements of the occupants, the latter will be enabled to carry on their busi- ness with as great, if not greater, advantage than under exisiting conditions. The quotation shews not that Lord Milner’s intentions are not good, but that they are not being carried out by those in whom is vested the administration of the Law 3 of 1885. Indeed, they are enforcing it in a manner most hostile to the Indians, because the law does not tie the Government down to selection of Bazaars in out-of - the-way corners only, but it gives them the power to point out streets, wards, and Locations for residence of the Asiatics. Lord Milner him- self contemplated the setting apart of streets, when he said in the same dispatch that “they will be required to remove to streets or Bazaars selected for this purpose”. It will, therefore, be seen that Lord Milner’s statement is as definite as it possibly can be; the least that is, therefore, expected of the Government is that they should give full effect to Lord Milner’s declaration, and save the British Indian traders from ruin by conti- nuing the renewal of their licences. New applicants may be treated, if they so choose, in a different manner. As shewing the apathy or hostility of the administration towards the Indian interests, the action of the Health Board at Barberton may be cited as an instance in point. There, as stated last week, the attempt was made to shift the present Location to a place further away from town. The Government have since written saying that the equipment of the present Location will not be disturbed, as the Health Board is not able to pay them compensation for removal, or to bear the cost thereof; but what has been given with one hand has been taken away with the other, because a Notice has just been issued signed by the Resident Magistrate, imposing on the tenancy of the present occupants new and extraordinary conditions, unheard of even between private parties; that is to say, if they do not want to remove to the new Locations, they will not be permitted to sub-let their premises, or even to have any visitors “on pain of eviction”, “in default of the payment of the rent due, on the prescribed date, the tenancy will be terminated”. The licences are never transferable in respect of place, or renewable, except for the present holders. Thus, the Board, if their decision is upheld, would have the satisfaction of removing the Indi- ans from the present Location without having to pay a single penny. All this is clearly contrary to Law 3 of 1885, for, at any rate, within the Location, the British Indians may have the same rights as any ordinary Individual. The matter has been placed before the Government. India Office: Judicial and Public Records, 402",

RESOLUTIONS The following resolutions were passed by the Council of the All- India Spinners’ Association at its meeting held at Wardha from 13th to 16th December 1926. I. Resolved that all sale depots conducted directly by the All-India Spinners’ Association or through provincial departm- ents be instructed strictly to avoid all sales on credit whether they be retail sales or wholesale transactions with other depots II. Resolved that cash securities be insisted on from hawkers covering the amount of stock taken by them for sales. In special cases, however, where desirable hawkers are unable to furnish such security, personal sureties may be taken from them. In all cases hawkers should be strictly warned that they should make no credit sales on any account and periodical settlements of accounts should be made. If at any time a hawker is unable to pay up the cash for the stock sold or the balance of stock does not tally, the hawker should be at once discharged and steps should be taken against him for recovery of the monies due. III. whereas it is not desirable that the sale depots should be run in places where the public does not give adequate supp- ort enabling them to be conducted without loss, all provincial departments are instructed to close down depots where, after two years’ experience, it is found that the charges incurred exceed 6/ 4% of the total sales effected per year, and to open new depots only where they expect this standard to be reached at least in the course of a year.

Whereas it is necessary, at present, to concentrate our efforts on such centres, where, by reason of greater unemploy- ment or special adaptability to the industry of hand-spinning and hand-weaving, there are greater facilities for the production of khadi, it is resolved that, in proposing schemes of work, provincial agents and secretaries should not undertake to open or maintain centres of production which can be run only at a loss. But where it is considered desirable in the interests of the movement that any centres should be run or maintained at a loss, it should be borne in mind that no more than 10% of the total capital invested for production in the province should be invested in such pioneer effort. KENYA INDIANS In another column is published a letter from Mr. D. B. Desai, a settler of Kenya, referring to an increase in the poll tax which Indians of Kenya have been made to pay for the past twelve years and more.{1} The letter is remarkable for the wealth of details it contains. If the facts set forth in it are true, it is a serious reflection upon the Europeans of Kenya and the Kenya Government. The reader will recollect that the Indians of Kenya did not submit to the poll tax without protest. Of course the protest was useless. But one would have thought that there would be no further addition to the iniquitous tax. If, however, my correspondent is right, by a currency trick the tax wasraised by 50 per cent., i.e., it went up from 20 shillings to 30 and now the amending legislation raises it to 50 shillings. The reasons given for the rise would seem to be utterly absurd. The reader must read the letter to know how the tax is to be utilized. The Kenya Indians have certainly every reason for hoping that the public and the Government will come to their assistance and demand a veto of this discriminating and unjust legislation.",

      "fullContent": "WORTHY OF EMULATION I reproduce the following relevant extract from a reader's letter from Palitana: {1} What a great advance in reform can be brought about if other servants emulate this example! Through such work one serves both the Ruler and the people, and one’s own interest as well. This couple will, by and by, have all their cotton and woollen garments made from yarn and wool spun by themselves. We have noted that among the Kaliparaj tribals the annual expenditure on clothes amounts to Rs. 10 for every person. The expenditure in the family of this correspondent must be even higher. He will save considerably on that expenditure and, in the bargain, will have acquired a skill, earned the blessings of the poor and learnt something about the varieties of cotton and wool and how to improve their quality. At this time when spinning and allied activities are making good progress in Kathiawar, I wish that officials of all grades who come into frequent contacts with the public in the course of their work should teach the people, as this correspondent does, to spin and do other work relating to khadi. This friend wants a portable spinning-wheel which can be carried on horse- back. Others, too, are likely to ask for such a wheel. But the right solution is that people in every village should have spinning-wheels in their homes. Whether in Kathiawar or elsewhere, there ought to be no village without at least one spinning-wheel. If in a village there is none, arrangements must be made to instal them, so that officials can borrow them and do their spinning. If all the people take up spinning, there should be in the central meeting place in every village two or three spinning-wheels which may be used by the patels{2} as also by the poor people and the officials on their visits. Meanwhile, however, the idea of having a portable spinning-wheel which can be carried on horse-back is an excellent one. KHADI STORE I frequently receive letters about the closure of the khadi store run by the Gujarat Provincial Congress Committee. One such letter is lying before me just now. I notice from it that there is some misunderstanding about this matter. I have never advised that the Provincial Committee should run no khadi store. What indeed I have suggested is that a khadi store which runs at a great loss or in which the loss is increasing, instead of diminishing, should be closed down, and that buying khadi for a store from outside Gujarat should be stopped. This advice is inspired by nothing else but a careful calculation and some knowledge of economics. I cannot, even in my dream, wish ill of other provinces and well to Gujarat. It is, however, of the very essence of the principle of swadeshi that one should serve one’s neighbours first. This principle is violated when wheat from the south is preferred to the wheat produced in Gujarat and the procedure, therefore, is detrimental to Gujarat, to the south and to the whole country. The philosophy of khadi had its origin in this principle. Let us now examine the aims we hope to serve through khadi. The first is that it will revive Indian villages. This can happen only when every village produces its own khadi. This in its turn is possible only if every province produces its own khadi and uses what it produces. The second aim behind khadi is to bring about a boycott of foreign cloth through it. This can be achieved only if India manufactures all the cloth its population requires. If Indians demand cloth similar to the foreign product, India cannot meet that demand. Indians, therefore, should accustom themselves to wear, with pleasure, such cloth as the country produces. If all the people insist on wearing only khadi manufactured in Andhra, Andhra cannot meet all that demand and the boycott of foreign cloth can never be achieved. Every province, therefore, should try to produce fine khadi. For the same reason, every province should produce its own khadi. As a general rule it is observed that, so long as there is no demand for a commodity, no effort is made to produce it. This certainly does not mean that no one should wear or order Andhra khadi. My only point is that the Congress at any rate should always adopt the ideal course. If it wishes, the public will adopt the second best course. If, because the ideal course is difficult, even the Congress does not adopt it, no one else is likely to do, and without such efforts success is impossible.",

      "fullContent": "1 9.The instinctive qualities attributed to the soul are the gunas of the individual. He who possesses the quality of maximum calm is sattvika or righteous. He who possesses the quality of maximum disquiet is rajasi or passionate. And he who lacks in both these qualities and is also wanting in awareness or knowledge is tamasi, which signifies darkness and ignorance. 10. Every wise person must possess the same qualities. He may appear to be impractical, but in reality, he is not so. 11. Ba is still so stupid that she does not understand even common duty. It pained me. There was only pity behind it. 12. The body can certainly reach the state of absolute brahmacharya and absolute truth. There can be no freedom from unavoidable violence like breathing. 13. That a passionless, perfect man should commit a blunder is a contradiction in terms like a son being born to a barren woman. It is possible that man would become free in spite of wearing foreign clothes. But let us not attain freedom by wearing foreign clothes. 14. A one-sided statement that the Buddha did not attain emancipation only because he ate non-vegetarian food cannot be true. 15. A person who has controlled the senses ultimately becomes incapable of sensual pleasures. But that is the capacity of the strong. 16. With growing compassion, there is greater calm, because then one is experiencing pain. It is the calm resulting from a sense of duty. Hence, a saintly man experiences calm in the midst of disquiet. 17. Truth means existing at all times. That passionless state pertains to Brahman. Hence it is that Truth is Brahman. 18. Self-introspection means constant awareness about the existence of soul, etc. 19. Being omniscient means having complete knowledge of soul. Liberation means absolute detachment with regard to worldly existence. Equanimity means being unconcerned about pleasure and pain, non-possession, neutrality, being and non-being, a state of nothingness, liberation. 20. Kindness, compassion, grace, love, justice. All prevailing everywhere in totality. Doer: One who does. A cobbler is not the doer of shoes. Equanimous: fair-minded. 21. Some other time. 22. The meaning of the first part is not clear. I have not yet come across a perfect brahmachari. Perfect brahamchari means an absolutely passionless man or woman. 23. Being unselfish is discarding selfishness. If we eliminate the self, we become selfless. Being unhappy at the unhappiness of the world menas to continue to serve without any reward. Renouncing the world for the sake of the soul. Even while interpreting to simply mean that we should renounce the world for moksha, it means that the world should be renounced even for the sake of the protection of the body. The soul is very often said to mean both the body and the physical. Where its meaning as the body creates a wrong impression, it should be taken to mean the physical. BAPUJI",

      "fullContent": "{1} June 11, 1945 Considering all that is happening around us, I see danger in this partnership with the League. One thing is definite, namely, that until the members of the Working Committee are freed and can express their opinion, nothing can be done in the name of the Congress. It is also definite that if the Chimur-Ashti prisoners and other such prisoners are hanged, the situation will become impossible. Unless the League’s attitude shows a change without any expectation of gain I will have no deal with it even if the Congress Working Committee consents. This is for you yourself to think over and decide. You are in a better position to understand the truth than anybody else. The distinction that is being made between the League Muslims and the others seems to me dangerous from every point of view. I don’t think it safe to countenance any such position. Think carefully over what you said last night regarding this. Will the 40 per cent Congress quota include any representatives of the Hindu Mahasabha or of Harijans? What about the Sikhs, Parsis, Christians, etc.? Whether you have discussed this with the League or not is irrelevant here. When the time for final decision comes, the Congress will have to consider all these points. The Congress will not be in the same position as the League. It will have to take into account all the interests in the country, whereas the League is concerned with the interests only of the Muslims supporting it. You will have to be ready to face all these complications. You will definitely not be able to bring the ship to port by disregarding the parties other than the League. Please understand my limitations fully before you proceed further. As I have explained, my temper is progressively becomingmore uncompromising. I use the word “uncompromising” in a good sense, so take it in that spirit. Against my indifference to the Parliamentary scheme and my increasing faith in non-violent non-co-operation, you can safely place my loyalty to you. It will not let myself go beyond the limits of what I have given you in writing. But it is difficult even for me to say where my uncompromising spirit will take me, for I am coming to put ever increasing faith in the Unseen Power and, therefore, I think very little about tomorrow. I started writing this before 6 and it is 6.30 now. I will write more if anything occurs to me. Otherwise take this as fully representing my views.",

But the foreign propaganda that Sarojini Devi would carry on during her tour in the West would be the propaganda that would tell more than anything that could be done by an established agency whose very existence would be unknown to the indifferent and would be ignored by those whose opinion would matter to us. Not so India’s Nightingale. She is known to the West. She would compel a hearing wherever she goes. She adds to her great eloquence and greater poetry a delicate sense of the true diplomacy that knows what to say and when to say it and that knows how to say the truth without hurting. We have every reason to expect much from her mission to the West. With the instinct of a gentlewoman she has gone with the resolution not to enter upon a direct refutation of Miss Mayo’s insolent libel{1}. Her presence and her exposition of what India is and means to her would be a complete answer to all the untruth that has been dinned into the ready ears of the American public by agencies whose one aim is to belittle India and all that is Indian.{2} RASHTRIYA STRI SABHA AND KHADI{3} For years past this Sabha has been doing valuable propaganda for khadi among the fashionable citizens of Bombay and elsewhere through introducing artistic designs in khadi. Through this work the Sabha is supporting in the city of Bombay over 250 needy girls of all classes. It has five centres through which the work is distributed. Naturally these girls have to be paid regularly from month to month. Under the cash system insisted upon by the All-India Spinners’ Association the Sabha is obliged to pay cash for all the khadi it buys. Experience has shown the Sabha that it must insist upon cash payment if it has to pay cash for work done and khadi bought. Moreover, all the sisters who are engaged in organizing this work are volunteers. It is therefore but right that they should expect khadi lovers who patronize their labours to pay cash for the orders they send. Shrimati Perinbai Captain has addressed on behalf of the Sabha a circular letter in which she commends to the buyers of the articles prepared by the Sabha the necessity for cash payment. There is no doubt that the Sabha deserves encouragement for the philanthropic and useful service it is rendering. Cash payment is the least encouragement that the Sabha has the right to expect. Those who buy these articles help not only the poorest among the villagers but also the needy girls of our cities.",

      "fullContent": "T O P ROVINCIAL S ECRETARIES I hope that Provincial Secretaries will continue to send to the General Secretary and to Young India office the returns of mem- bership from week to week and with such further details as may throw light on the working of the franchise. It is the easiest thing for Congress organizations to defeat the purpose of the new franchise. But they are expected to put their whole heart into it, to make it work successfully. Nor is mere enlistment the sole or even the chief part of the work. To keep up the membership requires ceaseless watching and continuously improved oraganization. It is no easy thing for those who have hitherto satisfied their national conscience by simply flinging a few rupees or a few annas into the Congress cash-box to think of the nation day after day and to labour for it even though it be for half an hour per day. Ten thousand such spinners will revolutionize our national life and bring light to the dim eyes of millions of paupers of India. These ten thousand spinners must be voluntary in every sense of the term—not the semi-starved spinners who spin for a living but who would give also perhaps half an hour to the nation free. I want these, too, if they will spin without undue pressure. But the real khaddar atmosphere—the atmosphere of action rather than speech, of self-help rather than helplessness—will be produced only by ten thousand spinners drawn from the middle class men and women who today belong to the Congress and work the organization. KHADDAR IN KATHIAWAR The Working Committee of the Kathiawar Political Conference has arrived at an important decision regarding khaddar propaganda. It resolved to collect cotton from the various districts of Kathiawar for distribution among spinners and get it spun. It had already received promises of over 300 maunds from donors. Now it had resolved to collect at least 800 maunds or, which is the same thing, Rs. 19,200 for the work. The idea is to get this cotton spun and woven into khaddar. Kathiawar is a poor peninsula with a very small rainfall. In some places there is a chronic famine condition. Thousands of women would spin for supplementing their slender resources. It has also thousands of weavers among untouchables, who for want of their hereditary occupation are obliged to go to Bombay or elsewhere and work as scavengers in order to keep body and soul together. Khaddar at the present moment is not as cheap as it might be. It has, therefore, been resolved to find out families that would spin for their own clothing if they had a supply of silvers at cheap rates and facilities for getting their yarn woven also at cheap rates. The Parishad has, therefore, in order to encourage such families, undertaken to supply silvers at 6 annas per lb., no family to be supplied with more than 10 lbs. during the year, and to pay half the cost of weaving. The khaddar will cost the consumer a little over a third of the cost of 3 1 4 annas per yard instead of 9 annas which is the usual rate ruling in Kathiawar. Thus he will have 50 p.c. bounty in order to induce him to spin and wear the khaddar woven out of his yarn. To put it another way it is proposed to clothe out of Rs. 19,000 worth of cotton at least 2,750 families consisting of husband, wife and child. The following wages will have been distributed or earned before the cotton becomes khaddar: Ginning800 Mds.Rs. 1,000 Carding800 Mds.Rs. 4,000 Spinning700 Mds.Rs. 7,000 Weaving675 Mds.Rs. 6,750 Total : Rs. 18,750 In the process of carding the weight will be reduced from 800 to 700 and in spinning it will be further reduced to 675 mds. In length the khaddar will be 67,500 yards and 30 inches in width. The count will be on an average 8. This is an experiment which is fraught with important economic consequences. The cotton, it will be noted, will be hand ginned. I hope to summarize the results of the experiment from time to time. I must mention here that it is possible to contemplate an experiment of his nature only because Kathiawar has got three well- managed khaddar centres with trained workers. The money has still to be collected and it must be inside of two months’ time. I hope that every Kathiawari will help either by contributing his labour or funds. FROM UPANISHADS Borodada{1}, who is ever watchful of the happenings in national affairs, sends me the following: In corroboration of what you have said in one of your excellent articles about the sinfulness of committing brutal crimes said to be sanctioned by high religious authorities of one’s own sect I quote with the greatest pleasure the following injunction of a Guru to his disciple given in the Taittiriya Upanishad: “Those actions which are irreproachable shalt thou practise, and no other. Whatsoever good actions we perform, those shalt thou look up to with reverence as examples to be followed, and no other.” KHADI WORKER’S DIFFICULTIES Sjt. Adi Narayan Chettiar who is in charge of organizing Congress members in Tamilnad has put a series of questions to which he would like me to reply. His first question is: Do you wish to discourage the enlistment of C class members hereafter, or do you advise the stopping of such enlistment altogether? I have no right to discourage the enlistment of C class members, i.e., those who buy yarn. They have as much right under the constitution to be enrolled as class A, i.e., self-spinners. But I will not encourage such enlistment. If I was a canvasser I would put forth my best efforts exclusively to the enlistment of A class, but gladly take in the others when they offer themselves for enlistment. The second question is: There are a large number of women in places like Tirupur, Pudupalaiyam, Tendiruperai, Adarampatnam, Kallakurichi, etc., who spin for their livelihood. Do you think some of these may be enrolled as Congress (A class) members— after explaining to them that by joining the Congress as members they throw their half an hour’s labour into the Nation’s begging bowl—only labour, for, I propose that the Congress Committees should supply them with the requisite cotton for spinning 2000 yards of yarn per month, gratis. I would certainly enlist these sisters as members if they understand what the Congress is and if they wear khaddar. The third question is: What is your advice as regards the employment of paid propagandists to stimulate hand-spinning and the enlistment of such spinners as Congress members as per Belgaum resolution? Paid workers may be certainly engaged wherever funds permit and funds should be obtained by begging cotton. The fourth is: Some want loans—and loans in my experience end in gifts for what of proper accounting and collecting agencies—of charkhas and even cotton as a condition precedent to their commencing to spin. I must say some of them are really poor people. Do you advise compliance with this request? If so, on what terms? Loans of charkhas, etc., ought to be given wherever necessary and reasonable security should be taken for return of the materials. Charkhas may be sold even on hire-purchase system. “TO BE ATTAINED” A friend writes: You have always preached that swaraj must be attained and not obtained. In this connection I send from Daniel’s Life of Woodrow Wilson, the following apposite passage, thinking it will interest you. “In his (Wilson’s{2}) minds, the means of bringing about democratic Government comes from within not without, by moral, not by physical, force.” “I have not read history” he said, “without observing that the greatest forces in the world, and the only permanent forces are the moral forces.”",

      "fullContent": "AMAZING IGNORANCE The Secretary, C. P. (Marathi) Congress Committee, writes: In the C. P. Legislative Council, while opposing the motion of Mr. G. R. Pradhan, recommending to the Local Government a grant of amnesty to political prisoners, etc., Mr. Gordon on behalf of the Local Government is reported to have stated that offenders like Avari, who incited murders and preached open violence, would never be pardoned by the Government. The ignorance of some of these officials is equalled only by their arrogance. They do not even care to study the facts on which they claim to speak with authority. If Mr. Gordon had taken the trouble to inquire, he would have discovered that Sjt. Avari had never incited to murder or violence. Whatever his faults, he was never guilty of incitement to violence. And Mr. Gordon added injury to insult by associating Sjt. Avari’s name with pardon. If I know him at all, I know that he will never be guilty of asking for pardon. As a satyagrahi that he has always professed to be, he could not ask for pardon. If he commits an offence, he serves his deserved punishment; if he seeks imprisonment as a civil resister, he could never seek pardon. MORE TEMPLES OPENED The Anti-Untouchability Committee appointed by the Working Committee is making steady progress. It reports that eight more temples owned by the Telugu Munurvar community residing in cosmopolitan Bombay were declared open on 2nd instant to the so-called ‘untouchables’. This opening was no hurried matter. The proposal was discussed in various meetings of the community, and the temples were thrown open to the ‘untouchables’ only when there was almost complete unanimity. At the last meeting presided over by Advocate Sayaji Lakshman Silam, member of the Corporation, there was only one dissentient when the final vote was taken. The resolution also appealed to the suppressed brethren to carry out internal reforms The Committee further reports that Dr. Patwardhan of Amraoti, President of the Hanuman Vyayam Prasarak Mandal, which has 4 branches in the town besides the Central Gymnasium which alone has a daily attendance of about 1,000 boys, and which has about 50 branches throughout Berar, has addressed a letter to the Secretary, Anti-Untouchability Committee, in the course of which he says:{1} Boys of the so-called untouchable classes are admitted to our gymnasiums along with the boys of the so-called caste Hindus on terms of absolute equality, and no distinction whatever is made as to their instruction or treatment.... These are encouraging events. All the parties concerned deserve congratulations. But for the ready atmosphere Advocate Silam could never have carried the whole of the Munurvar community with him. Dr. Patwardhan’s letter does not surprise me. He is an old worker in the field, and it would have been surprising indeed if he had been found behind the times. Let us hope that before long temples and institutions shutting their doors against the suppressed classes will be among the exceptions and not the rule as they still unfortunately are today. The appeal made by the Munurvars to the suppressed class for internal reform is quite relevant. The two movements, internal reform by the latter and repentance by the so-called ‘touchables’, should go hand in hand. OVERCROWDING IN TRAINS Sjt. T. N. Sharma of Anandaniketan, Andhra Desha, writes:{2} In my opinion the idea of stopping the train by pulling the chain to avoid overcrowding is quite sound. If the railway authorities enforce the rule of numbers for 1st and 2nd class compartments, why will they not for the 3rd class? The overcrowding is at times suffocating as was described the other day by Shrimati Mirabehn in these pages.{3} It is largely greed of profits that makes the authorities indifferent to the comfort of the uncomplaining submissive 3rd class passengers who provide the profits, not 1st and 2nd class passengers. It will be interesting to know why Sjt. Shrihariray is being prosecuted if the facts are as stated above. FIVE CONUNDRUMS Sjt. P. K. Majumdar, Bar-at-Law of Jalapahar, asks the following questions which are preceded by a long argument which I omit, as it is contained in the questions themselves: 1. Is Man a special creation of God? 2. Does the ‘Inner Voice’ mean the ‘message of God’? 3. Defenceless as India is in the way of arms and ammunition, is it wise to court ‘force’ from a war-equipped opponent on the off chance of being successful by the use of ‘soul force’ with the consequent risk of civil war or foreign invasion? 4. Does ‘soul force’ mean what a man cannot do physically but is latent in his ‘soul’? 5. Is ‘soul’ something apart from ‘life’? The answers are: 1. Man is a special creation of God precisely to the extent that he is distinct from the rest of His creation. 2. The ‘Inner Voice’ may mean a message from God or from the Devil, for both are wrestling in the human breast. Acts determine the nature of the voice. 3. The most defenceless mouse struggles for liberty against his born enemy the cat who is armed to the teeth. The mouse does not court ‘force’. It is his nature to struggle though he knows that he will be worsted in the unequal contest. It is only reserved for man to act less than the mouse, if it is also reserved for him to act infinitely better than the mouse by recognizing the inner power within him which has been known repeatedly to defy all the physical forces arrayed against it. The risk of civil war is nothing against the fact of the existing condition in which an enslaved India feels powerless to struggle for freedom even to the extent that the poor mouse does. 4. Soul force begins when man recognizes that body force, be it ever so great, is nothing compared to the force of the soul within, which pervades not only him but all creation. 5. Soul is apart from life. The latter is conditioned by the body, the former is not. Since my legal correspondent has asked for my opinion as ‘senior counsel’, the fee for it is that he should give up his gown, and wear the Congress uniform and join the battle for freedom in spite of the odds against us. If he pays the fee, he will discover that the opinion was worth it.",

      "fullContent": "The All-India Khadi Board tested the yarn collected by them and I give below{1} the results which are interesting and instructive. Next month all provinces should kindly send the correct registration numbers of the yarn of members and of other individuals. Some provinces addressed their parcels to Ahmedabad station; this caused waste of time and money. All are to be addressed to Sabarmati Station. Moreover all the parcels are to be marked”To pay” and no one should fail to remit the amount either in stamps or by money order. It is a matter of pride for all of us that an eighteen-year-old Bengali girl gets the first prize. This may not interest some and some others may consider it trivial, but for me it has a significance. I would not have dreamt Darbar Saheb Gopaldas topping the list from Gujarat. I congratulate him. Similar is the case with Pandit Jawaharlal and his wife. From the United Provinces the names of these two and Shri Purushottamdas Tandon shine out. It should be noted that Pandit Jawaharlal has sent 4,000 yards of yarn in spite of his heavy burden of work. This should encourage other workers. It is not surprising that Gujarat ranks first in terms of overall numbers and quality. What is surprising is that in comparison with its population, very few names have been received even from Gujarat. By now thousands of expert spinners, men and women, should have become active in this region where there are many instructors and where much attention is paid to developing the craft of spinning. This is one side. The satisfaction that the largest number hails from Gujarat is the other side. More yarn is obtained from places where more work is put in. Gujarat leads in this effort and hence its output of yarn is the highest. Again, the paucity indicates that the country has not yet realized the importance of spinning and that the craft has not yet become as popular as it ought to be. Results of the next month may throw more light. Navajivan, 7-9-1924",

      "fullContent": "{1} People get weary of the trouble caused to them by monkeys. In their hearts they wish them dead. They are inwardly pleased if anyone kills them. At the same time they will oppose their slaughter. A friend who is well acquainted with the scriptures writes that monkeys ruin the crops, they even kidnap children, carry away articles, and eat up fruit, etc. Their number is daily increasing. I am asked as to what non-violence dictates in the matter. My ahimsa is my own. I am not able to accept in its entirety the doctrine of non-killing of animals. I have no feeling in me to save the lives of animals which devour or cause hurt to man. I consider it wrong to help in the increase of their progeny. Therefore, I will not feed ants, monkeys or dogs. I will never sacrifice a man’s life in order to save theirs. Thinking along these lines I have come to the conclusion that to do away with monkeys where they have become a menace to the well- being of man is pardonable. Such killing becomes a duty. The question may arise as to why this rule should not also apply to human beings. It cannot because, however bad, they are as we are. Unlike the animal, man has been given the faculty of reason.

Tendulkar, President, Goa Congress Committee is the last one from Goa who has come to me with the latest news from the place.{1} He tells me that there are several parties there, working not necessarily for its inhabitants but for power. Yet at bottom the fight is good. He has produced voluminous papers in support of the statement that confusion reigns supreme in the minds of Goans, correctly described as Gomantakas. This confusion is bad in that the inhabitants of these Portuguese possessions are novices in the art of real politics. Its separate existence, it is clear, can only depend on the goodwill of the mighty British Government and the impotence of its Indian residents. It is therefore most essential for the success of the movement that it should be conducted by the Gomantakas on the clearest possible issue, i. e., civil liberty. The larger question of swaraj should await its attainment by the whole of India unless of course the Portuguese Government wisely come to terms with the inhabitants of the settlement through friendly negotiations. It cannot be attained by any direct action of the citizens, whether violent or non-violent. In non-violent action success is assured where every inhabitant is a hero ready to lay down his or her life. It is less to be thought of in Goa than in the more numerous and better seasoned and awakened British India. Therefore the clearest possible issue of civil liberty must be kept steadily in view. The second condition of success is that the fight must be through non-violent and therefore also entirely open means. Thirdly, there should be no parties struggling for power and position. Where the goal and the means are common, different parties have no meaning. On reading the literature I find two persons called loyalists who have already made lavish declarations saying that nothing is wrong in Goa and that a false agitation is being carried on by some mischievous persons. Let not the circle of these loyalists grow larger. The best way to avoid this growth is for all parties to become one. PANCHGANI, July 24, 1946",

The essay that is now being presented to the public is the result of the joint effort of these two winners who were requested to amalgamate their essays and give a joint production. It is difficult to say how far the effort is an improvement upon the originals. But workers in the vast field of hand-spinning will find ample material in the following pages to strengthen their position and I should be much surprised if the sceptic does not find enough food for reflection. The authors have applied themselves to an examination prin- cipally of the following propositions: Are there millions in India who require a supplementary occu- pation, the majority being idle for want of it during at least four months in the year? Is hand-spinning the only supplementary occu- pation and, if it is, can it be easily taken up by the people? Is it possi- ble to sell khaddar woven from hand-spun yarn among the people in the teeth of the competition offered by foreign and Indian mills? The readers will find that the authors have endeavoured to give an affirmative answer to all these important questions. Is it not the duty of everyone who wants to see an amelioration in the condition of India’s masses carefully to read what the authors have stated and to support the khaddar movement if they accept their conclusions? Let them denounce it as a waste of effort, if they can dare controvert the facts adduced by the authors. M. K. GANDHI",

      "fullContent": "JOHANNESBURG, August 22, 1903 Lord Milner’s dispatch, dated May 11 and addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, has been received by this week’s mail. The Indian community is grateful to His Excellency for the sympathy he has shown for them and regard for their feelings. There are, however, statements therein which require correction. It appears that they have been made on the persistent assertions of the members of the White League. His Excellency says in his despatch: Had we had to deal merely with the Asiatic population as it existed before the war, it might have been possible to remain passive until a new law could have been framed to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government But, with so many newcomers constantly pouring in and applying for licences to trade, and with the European population protesting with ever-increasing vehemence against the indiscriminate granting of such licences and against the neglect of the Government to enforce the law which restricts Asiatics to locations specially set apart for their residence, it became impossible to persist in the policy of complete inaction. It is submitted that the Asiatic population even at the present day is smaller than it was before the war. The registration law has been enforced, and the result has been to show that there are not more than 10,000 Indians at present in the Colony. The official report published by the Government shows that there were at least 15,000 British Indians in the Colony prior to the war. Both these statements are official. Moreover, stringent “permit” regulations prevent any but British Indian refugees from entering the Transvaal. It is, therefore, hardly correct to say that the enforcement of the law became necessary owing to “so many newcomers constantly pouring in and applying for licences to trade”. Moreover, the Bazaar Notice deals not merely with applicants for new licences but with all, whether they held licences prior to the war or not, subject to reservations made therein. Had the Government declined to issue licences to non-refugees, there would be nothing to complain about, but as it is, the whole of the law is at present directed against bona fide refugees. His Excellency says: The Government are anxious, however, to do so (enforce the law) in the manner most considerate to the Indians already settled in the country, and with the greatest respect for vested interests, even where these have been allowed to spring up contrary to law. As has already been said in a previous letter, as well as in the printed memorial{1} submitted to His Excellency, vested interests are not respected in the sense here understood. Hundreds of Indians whotraded before the war contrary to law (that is, without licences) are under notice to remove to Locations at the end of the year, causing complete dislocation of Indian businesses. Moreover, all the partners of a single firm are not allowed licences, but only one of them who happens fortunately to be in the country and anticipate his other part- ners. Nor are they allowed to remove their trade from one place to another in different districts. Nor are the licences transferable from one person to another, a prohibition which completely deprives the trader of the value of his goodwill. Thus, it will be seen that every Indian trader must ultimately remove his business to the Location. His Excellency says (in answer to the complaint that the anti-Asiatic laws are being more rigorously enforced under the British regime than under the Boer regime): (1) It (Government) is providing in every town special quarters in which Asiatics may reside, and in the selection of these quarters, it is doing its best to choose sites not only healthy but affording reasonable opportunities for trade. (2) It has declared its intention not to disturb Asiatics who had established themselves in business before the war,. but to renew their licences. Under the old Government, all these men were under notice to quit. (3) It proposes to exempt Asiatics of a superior class from all special legislation. With reference to the first, it is hardly a relief that Locations will be established in every town, for it is against the establishment of these that the Indians very successfully protested under the old regime. With the exception, therefore, of a few towns, the late Transvaal Government did not dare lay out any Locations. Now the Government have already selected sites for nearly twenty townships. As to the choice of healthy sites affording reasonable opportunities for trade, in the absence of any information, it is difficult to say much, but what is already known is not very reassuring. In spite of the protests of the British Indians, the existing Location at Barberton is to be removed away, and though the distance is not very great, it is easy to understand what a great loss the traders of the Location must suffer by reason of the removal. As to the second, under the Boer regime, and in spite of any non-declaration of intention not to disturb vested rights, the representations of British Agents protected them all up to the outbreak of hostilities. The notices to quit were then considered not to be worth the paper on which they were written (for all the Indian traders were under notice for several years, and yet they were never enforced). As soon as an attempt was made, a protest was sent to the Home Government and relief was instantaneous. As to the third, if the exemption was of the nature contemplated by Lord Milner, namely, “from all special legislation”, it would undoubtedly be of considerable advantage, but the Bazaar Notice is in conflict with any such view. It merely grants exemption as to residence. The humour of the situation lies in the fact that respectable British Indians, if they would live in towns after the end of the year, would have to get special exemption and prove to the authorities that “they are in the habit of using soap”, and that “they do not sleep on the floor”, and so on. But Indians of the servant class are, by law, entitled to reside in towns without any special permission being necessary there-under, for the section of the law reads: “The Government shall have the right to appoint special streets, wards and locations as their residence. This provision shall not apply to servants living with their masters.” Hundreds of Indian servants, therefore, if not thousands, (for they are very much appreciated as domestic servants), may live in towns without having to make any application for exemption, but a handful of well-to-do, respectable British Indians may not reside in towns with out having to undergo the indignity of an offensive examination. No such exemption was necessary under the old regime because compulsory segregation was never adopted. The statement, therefore, made by the British Indians that the anti-Asiatic laws are being enforced with a rigour never before known, is literally true. As to the charge of insanitation based on an extract from Dr. Porter’s report, the enclosed article from Indian Opinion speaks for itself. If prejudiced statements were made against British Indians prior to the war, statements utterly unsupported by facts, the British Indians are still labouring under the same prejudice. The evidence of Dr. Porter falls undoubtedly under the same category. To pass to another matter, the British Indian Mahomedans at Pretoria bought a piece of property for the purpose of erecting a mosque in Pretoria some fifteen years ago. This property still remains in the name of the seller owing to the Boer law prohibiting the ownership of land by Asiatics outside Locations or streets set apart by Government. Several representations were made to the British Agents prior to the war, and on the eve of it, Sir Conyngham Green assured the British Indians that, if war broke out, there would be no difficulty about the transfer after its conclusion. In spite of several representations, the Government has refused at present to allow the land to be registered in the names of the trustees. A letter has been addressed to the Colonial Secretary by Mr. Hajee Habib on behalf of the Mahomedan congregation.{2} The seller is a very old man and, in the event of his unfortunately dying before the transfer is given, complications may arise meaning loss of property which is very valuable to the British Indian Mahomedans in Pretoria. The same difficulty has been experienced in Johannesburg with reference to the Johannesburg Mosque, but here the need is not so great, as the seller is not in the same position as the seller at Pretoria. It is, therefore, hoped that Mr. Chamberlain will be pleased to induce the Government to grant the transfer.",

      "fullContent": "A member of the All-India Spinners’ Association writes as follows: Khadi is woven from the yarn received from the members and then it is sold. How are the proceeds utilized? Would it be wrong if this khadi was supplied to the poor at a cheaper rate, charging only the weaving expenses, etc.? What advantage do you find in the present system? I wish you to clarify this matter through Navajivan. I think that this question has already been answered once. The yajna yarn is received in a very limited quantityand though its quality is improving day by day and so irregularly that it can just cover the expenses of collecting and storing. Hence the khadi made from this yarn is sold at ordinary rates. Sufficient khadi to meet the demands of poor people is produced neither from yajna yarn nor from any other yarn. But the yajna yarn amply feeds the poor. The khadi that is produced out of the yarn spun by the poor costs more per yard than mill-made cloth. Yet the middle and the rich classes are trying to ensure the success of the art of spinning by purchasing it. When this yajna which is now being performed on a small scale becomes widespread, khadi will be given almost free to the poor, while the rich and the middle classes will wear khadi available at low price. At present the yarn received by the Spinners’ Association satisfies the sentiment which when developed will fulfil the material need. If the Spinners’ Association has no members and if there is no condition of good spinning, then there would be no one carrying on khadi work as at present. Thus even though the poor are not enabled to wear khadi made of yarn received by the Spinners’ Association, yet they derive all the benefits of its activities. The very existence of the Spinners’ Association is for the benefit of the poor.",

On the contrary I have expressed my unstinted admiration for the single-minded devotion with which they carried on the Ashram under those difficult and anxious 21 months.

(5) If we want it to appear that he is a Hindu, Muslims should take the lead in honouring him, that being the only way to promote fraternal relations between the two sections ; (6) For welcoming Mr. Gokhale we need to raise a large sum of money.

      "fullContent": "I have kept the following letter{1} with me for a number of days. I have not reproduced some part of the letter which contains details. How far the evils mentioned in the letter are real—Patidars alone know. I am supposed to have stayed among them for a time and yet, my task being to know the good qualities, made no attempt to acquaint myself with their defects, nor did anyone draw my attention to them. But if the account given in the letter is true, that should put us to shame. The sinful superstition that the birth of a baby girl is in auspicious is common among us. This superstition has as its basis mere selfishness. It might well have originated in the dark ages. That people should have detested the birth of a female child in the age when virgins were being kidnapped is in some measure understan- dable. Today that fear is practically non-existent. Even if it were there, we are in a position to take remedial measures. If there is any reason to rejoice at a birth, we should rejoice whether it is the birth of a boy or a girl; both should be equally dear to us. The world certainly needs both. One is a complement to the other. That being so, to rejoice at the birth of one and to feel depressed at the birth of the other benefits neither. In a well-balanced society, the proportion of men and women ought to be equal. It is common in Hindu society that the father of a girl has to bear heavy expenses on the occasion of her wedding. Perhaps this custom assumed grave proportions among the Patidars. There cannot be two opinions on the absolute need to do away with this expendi- ture. A very expensive custom only ruins poor parents and it becomes almost impossible for them to get their daughters married and con- sequently there arises the practice of administering poison to girls. The example{2} the teacher of Sunav has set is worth following. In this age of khadi, weddings can certainly be celebrated with only khadi garlands. The writer has thrown the entire blame on the old folk. There must be some exaggeration in this. But if the old should remain still obstinate owing to their proud temper, youth organizations should take control. If the young would firmly decline to participate in expensive weddings, the extravagance would at once stop. For this neither discourtesy nor great effort is called for. The deplorable thing is that till today the youths have regarded such matters as outside their sphere of activity. They have never used their educational attainments for securing social reform. But the order of things has changed now. The young have begun to think for themselves. Hence this reform can be effected without great effort. Only unshakable determination is called for. I for one do not like even the association of twelve villages.{3} I believe in the four castes only. It is necessary to merge the sub-castes. But that will take time. Yet, to divide Patidars into groups of villages is the climax of caste division. Why should those who can interdine with the Patidars of the whole of Gujarat not intermarry with them? Mere pride, and not restraint, is responsible for the creation of this twelve-village association. Where there is false pride, there is sin. Hence wise and experienced Patidars should join hands to bring about the desired reform ant immediately put an end to the infanticide of girls and the above-mentioned wicked practices responsible for it.",

I am aware that I must have, though quite unconsciously, given him causes for irritation. I must have also tried his patience but I cannot recall an occasion when he allowed himself to be betrayed into irrita- tion or impatience. I must add that he was frank throughout these very delicate negotiations and I believe he was determined, if it was at all possible, to have a settlement. I must confess that I approached the negotiations in fear and trembling. I was also filled with distrust but at the very outset he disarmed my suspicions and put me at ease. For myself, I can say without fear of contradiction that when I wrote my letter inviting the invitation to see him, I was determined not to be outdone in the race for reaching a settlement, if it could be reached at all honourably. I am, therefore, thankful to the Almighty that the settlement was reached and the country has been spared, at least for the time being, and I hope for all time, the suffer-ings which in the event of a breakdown would have been intensified a hundred fold. For a settlement of this character, it is not possible nor wise to say which is the victorious party. If there is any victory, I should say it belongs to both. The Congress has never made any bid for victory. In the very nature of things the Congress has a definite goal to reach and there can be no question of victory without reaching the goal. I would, therefore, urge all my countrymen and all my sisters instead of feeling elated, if they find in the terms any cause for ela- tion, to humble themselves before God and ask Him to give them strength and wisdom to pursue the course that their mission demands for the time being, whether it is by way of suffering or by way of patient negotiation, consultation and conference. I hope, therefore, that the millions who have taken part in this struggle of suffering during the past twelve months will now, during This appeared as “Press Statement” on “the terms of truce to a gathering of American and Indian journalists and Pressmen”. 208 the period of conference and construction, show the same willingness, the same cohesion, the same effort and the same wisdom that they have in an eminent degree shown during what I would describe as a heroic period in the modern history of India. But I know that, if there would be men and women who will feel elated by the settlement, there are, also those who will be, and are, keenly disappointed. Heroic suffering is like the breath of their nostrils. They rejoice in it as in nothing else. They will endure unendurable sufferings, be they ever so prolonged, but when suffering ceases they feel their occupation gone and feel also that the goal has receded from the view. To them I would only say, ‘Wait, watch, pray and hope.’ Suffering has its well-defined limits. Suffering can be both wise and unwise, and when the limit is reached, to prolong it would be not unwise but the height of folly. It would be folly to go on suffering when the opponent makes it easy for you to enter into a discussion with him upon your long- ings. If a real opening is made, it is one’s duty to take advantage of it and, in my humble opinion, the settlement has made a real opening. Such a settlement has necessarily to be provisional as this is. The peace arrived at is conditional upon many other things happening. The largest part of the written word is taken up with what may be called ‘Terms of Truce’. This had to be naturally so. Many things had to happen before the Congress could participate in the delibe- rations of the Conference. A recital of these was absolutely necessary. But the goal of the Congress is not to get a redress of past wrongs important though they are: its goal is purna swaraj which, indiffe- rently rendered in English, has been described as complete indepen- dence. It is India’s birthright, as it is of any other nation worthy of that name, and India cannot be satisfied with anything less and throughout the settlement one misses that enchanting word. The clause which carefully hides that word is capable, and intentionally capable, of a double meaning. Federation may be a mirage or it may mean a vital organic state in which the two limbs might work so as to strengthen the whole. Responsibility, which is the second girder, may be a mere shadow or it may be tall, majestic, unbending and unbendable oak. Safeguards in the interests of India may be purely illusory and so many ropes tying the country hand and foot and strangling her by the neck, or they may be like so many fences protecting a tender plant requiring delicate care and attention. One party may give one meaning and another may give the three girders the other meaning. It is open under that clause to either party to work along its own lines and the Congress if it has shown readiness to take part in the deliberation of the Conference, it is because it seeks to make Federation, Responsibility, Safeguards, reser- vations, or whatever other names they may be known by, such as would promote the real growth of the country along political, social, economic and moral lines. If the Congress succeeds in making its position acceptable to the Conference, then, I claim that the fruit of that effort will be complete independence. But I know that the way to it is weary. There are many rocks, many pitfalls, to be found across the way. But if Congressmen will approach the new task to which they are called, with confidence and courage, I have no misgivings about the result. It is, therefore, in their hands either to make something noble and worth looking at out of the new opportunity that has come to them or, by lack of self- confidence and want of courage, to fritter away the opportunity. But I know that in this task Congressmen will require the aid of the other parties, the aid of the great Princes of India, and last but by no means the least the aid of Englishmen. I need not make any appeal at the present juncture to the different parties. I have little doubt that they are no less eager than Congressmen for the real freedom of their country. But the Princes are a different proposition. Their acceptance of the idea of Federation was certainly for me a surprise, but if they will become equal partners in Federated India, I venture to suggest that of their own free will they should advance towards the position that what is called British India has been all these long years seeking to occupy. An undiluted autocracy, however benevolent it may be, and an undiluted democracy are an incompatible mixture bound to result in an explosion. It is, therefore, I think, necessary for them not to take up an uncompromising attitude and impatiently refuse to listen to an appeal from or on behalf of the would-be partner. If they refused any such appeal they would make the position of the Congress untenable and, indeed, most awkward. The Congress represents, or endeavours to represent, the whole of the people of India. It recognizes no dis- 210 tinction between those who reside in British India or in Indian States. The Congress has, with great wisdom and equally great restraint, refrained from interfering with the doings and affairs of the States and it has done so in order, not to unnecessarily wound the susceptibilities of the States, but, also, by reason of the self-imposed restraint, to make its voice heard by the States on a suitable occasion. I think that, that occasion has now arrived. May I then hope that the great Princes will not shut their ears to the Congress appeal on behalf of the people of the States? I would like to make a similar appeal to the English. If India is to come to her own through conference and consultation, the goodwill and active help of Englishmen are absolutely necessary. I must con - fess, that what seems to have been yielded by them at the Conference in London is not even half enough—no approach to the goal that India has in view. If they will render real help, they must be prepared to let India feel the same glow of freedom which they themselves would die in order to possess. These English statesmen would have to dare to let India wander away into the woods through errors. Free- dom is not worth having if it does not connote freedom to err and even to sin. If God Almighty has given the humblest of His creatures the freedom to err, it passes my comprehension how human beings, be they ever so experienced and able, can delight in depriving other human beings of that precious right. Anyway, the implication of inviting the Congress to join the Conference is most decidedly that the Congress may not be deterred from any consideration, save that of incapacity, from pressing for the fullest freedom. And the Congress does not consider India to be a sickly child requiring nursing, outside help, and other props. I would like also to register my appeal to the people of the great American Republic and the other nations of earth. I know that this strug-gle based as it is on truth and non-violence from which, alas, we the votaries have on occasion undoubtedly strayed, has fired their imagination and excited their curiosity. From curiosity they, and spe- cially America, has progressed to tangible help in the way of sym- pathy. And I can say on behalf of the Congress and myself that we are all truly grateful for all that sympathy. I hope that in the difficult mission in which the Congress is now about to embark, we shall not only retain their sympathy but that it will grow from day to day. I The source has “There”. venture to suggest, in all humility, that if India reaches her destiny through truth and non-violence, she will have made no small contribution to the world peace for which all the nations of the earth are thirsting and she would also have, in that case, made some slight return for the help that those nations have been freely giving to her. My last appeal is to the Police and the Civil Service departments. The settlement contains a clause which indicates that I had asked for an inquiry into some of the police excesses which are alleged to have taken place. The reason for waiving that inquiry is stated in the settlement it-self. The Civil Service is an integral part of the machinery which is kept going by the police department. If they really feel that India is soon to become mistress in her own household and they are to serve her loyally and faithfully as her servants, it behoves them, even now, to make the people feel that when they have to deal with the members of the Civil Service and the police department, they are really dealing with their servants, honoured and wise undoubtedly, but nevertheless servants and not masters. I owe a word to hundreds, if not thousands, of my erstwhile fellow-prisoners on whose behalf I have been receiving wires and who will still be languishing in jails when satyagrahi prisoners who were jailed during the past 12 months will have been discharged. Personally, I do not believe in imprisoning, by way of punish- ment, even those who commit violence. I know that those who have done violence through political motives are entitled to claim, if not the same wisdom, certainly the same spirit of love and self-sacrifice that I would claim for myself. And, therefore, if I could have justly sec- ured their liberty in preference to my own or that of fellow-satya- grahis I should truthfully have secured it. But I trust they will realize that I could not in justice ask for their discharge. But that does not mean that I or the members of the Working Committee have not them in mind. The Congress has embarked deliberately, though provisionally, on a career of co-operation. If congressmen honourably and fully implement the conditions applicable to them of the settlement, the Congress will obtain an irresistible prestige and would have inspired Government with confidence in its ability to ensure peace, as I think it has proved its ability to conduct disobedience. And if the people in general will clothe the Congress with that power and prestige, I promise that it will not be long before every one of these political prisoners is discharged including the detenus, the Meerut prisoners and all the rest. 212 There is, no doubt, a small but active organization in India which would secure India’s liberty through violent action. I appeal to that organization, as I have done before, to desist from its activities, if not yet out of conviction, then out of expedience. They have perhaps somewhat realized what great power non-violence has. They will not deny that the almost miraculous mass awakening was possible only because of the mysterious and yet unfailing effect of non-violence. I want them to be patient, and give the Congress, or if they will, me, a chance to work out the plan of truth and non-violence. After all it is hardly yet a full year since the Dandi march. One year in the life of an experiment affecting 300 millions of human beings is but a second in the cycle of time. Let them wait yet awhile. Let them preserve their precious lives for the service of the Motherland to which all will be presently called and let them give to the Congress an opportunity of securing the release of all the other political prisoners and maybe even rescuing from the gallows those who are condemned to them as being guilty of murder. But I want to raise no false hopes. I can only state publicly what is my own and the Congress aspiration. It is for us to make the effort. The result is always in God’s hands. One personal note and I have done. I believe that I put my whole soul into the effort to secure an honourable settlement. I have pledged my word to Lord Irwin that in making good the terms of the settlement in so far as they bind the Congress, I should devote myself heart and soul to the task. I worked for the settle- ment, not in order to break it to pieces at the very first oppor- tunity, but in order to strain every nerve to make absolutely final what today is provisional and to make it a precursor of the goal to attain which the Congress exists. Lastly, I tender my thanks to all those who have been unceasing in their efforts in making the settlement possible.",

      "fullContent": "Referring to Rajkumari Amrit Kaur’s visit to Morvi during the Rentia Jayanti celebrations, the Dewan writes as follows:{1} His Highness the Maharaja Saheb has been giving for some years Rs. 10,000 every year during the Gandhi Jayanti for the benefit of the Harijans and khadi. Sometimes the amount is sent to you as was done last year, and many times the amount is spent in Morvi for Harijans and for the encouragement of khadi.. .. This year we are hard hit by famine. We have organized relief measures on an extensive scale.. .. Cheap grain and grass depots are opened throughout the State where food and fodder are distributed on cash and credit.. .. Agriculturists are given food and fodder on credit.. .. and.. . are helped to grow fodder crops by giving loans for seeds. Every available source of water is used for irrigation by setting up small pumping plants. You will be glad to learn that one of the activities of famine relief is to produce khadi. The Famine Department purchases raw cotton, and all operations from carding to weaving are paid for at reasonable rates. The State takes all the khadi that is being produced. It is hoped that this will give the much required employment to a large section of the people—most of them Harijans—at their doors. This year His Highness has decided to distribute khadi worth Rs. 1,000 to the needy, and owing to scarcity conditions many will need free help of clothing. This will be his usual donation on Gandhi Jayanti.. . . Bhangis and Meghwars would not use the common tank for taking their water and the State had closed it till their differences were composed. During the period of the existing stress they have made up their differences and now they use the common tank. During the year the State has provided two measures for the benefit of the lower ranks of State service which include Harijans—one is to give them loans without interest, and the other is to give female servants the benefit of one month’s maternity leave on full pay. Seeing that generally it falls to my lot to criticize the States, it is a pleasure to be able to record the good work done in Morvi in connection with famine. I congratulate the Maharaja Saheb on the effort that is being put forth to alleviate distress. As to khadi I would like to suggest that if it is to become a permanent insurance against famine, the Maharaja Saheb and the people of Morvi have to use khadi for their personal and domestic use. Morvi grows good cotton enough for its requirements. Its people can produce all the khadi they need. Those who are too poor to pay the higher price at which khadi must be sold if it is to give an adequate wage to the spinners, should become spinners themselves. Shri Narandas Gandhi’s yearly experiments have shown progressively the immense possibilities in this direction. But these latent virtues of khadi cannot be brought out so long as the Maharaja Saheb and the people of Morvi remain distant patrons instead of becoming lovers and wearers themselves of khadi. It is suicidal economy to buy cheap mill-cloth even though the people can easily produce enough khadi in their own homes without much extra effort or outlay of capital. SEGAON, October 16, 1939",

It is to the effect that we should at these meetings take a definite practical step from year to year to promote some public object in keeping with the teachings of the deceased patriot. Ahmedabad will probably raise subscriptions for translating and publishing in Gujarati Mr. Gokhale’s speeches to be ready for circulation at the latest on the next anniversary. Other centres may translate other works or may raise subscriptions to found scholarships for some special training. If some such definite and not very ambitious steps are taken at the hundreds of meetings that will be held yearly, the educational advance we shall have in a few years will, it is held, be not inconsiderable.",

The Congress took a correct attitude and has vindicated its national character. M. N. T. Mutual apportionment of blame has begun between the Congress and the League leaders and the papers. Would this not embitter relations and dash hopes of any future settlement, thus drifting to a position of civil war and riots? G. Mutual recriminations should not be indulged in though truth will have to be spoken. There is a danger of the situation drifting into a civil war. The clash at Delhi station before Maulana Azad’s compart-ment is a pointer. But the police should not be allowed to maintain order amongst us. But if riots take place what can we do? Riots have always been taking place. Even in the reign of . . .{2} riots and disturb-ances took place. This country is inhabited by a very large population of various conflicting ideas. M. N. T. Civil disturbances of the older days were no comparison to those of today with their political and economic implications. Patriots of the Congress and the League would fight instead of uniting for people’s service, with the result that the people would lose faith in the honesty and patriotism of both. Their miseries would increase tenfold and the national movement would go to pieces. G. Yes. We should make efforts not to let such a situation develop. M. N. T. Do you hope that the Congress and the League will be able to settle in the near future? G. We should all hope so. M. N. T. The belief of the common man is that the Conference broke over the question of a single seat due to dissensions among the leaders. G. It is wrong to say that the Conference broke over the question of one seat. The Congress fought for a principle. M. N. T. Even if the Congress had to nominate only Hindu Congressmen, they could very well have represented the Nationalist Muslims and safeguarded their interests. There is no difference between Congressman and Congressman. G. But we were seeking able men of all parties and communities. We did not bother which party got what number of seats. M. N. T. You had accepted the Bhulabhai Formula{3} of Congress-League parity and gave a public statement{4} to that effect. But the Congress Working Committee agreed to Hindu-Muslim parity, proposed by Wavell,{5} thus raising the rock of breakdown, since Congress and League could not agree to the nomination of one by the other. Is it a fact that the Working Committee disagreed with you and rejected the Congress-League parity formula? G. Now you are dragging me into deep water. Yes. The truth is something like this. I shall write about it in the near future. M. N. T. You perhaps know that the Communists’ main slogan all through the Conference has been “transform Hindu-Muslim parity into Congress-League parity” and they are making efforts in the direction. G. They should continue their efforts. M. N. T. On what grounds did your correspondence with P. C. Joshi{6} break? G. Who says it has broken down? M. N. T. Has the Working Committee taken any decision regarding the Communists? G. No. It has not taken any decision. M. N. T. You know the ban of the U. P. Government continues on the three Communist weeklies{7} in U. P. G. Have they not yet lifted the ban? It is very wrong for the Government to do so. M. N. T. Sjt. J. C. Gupta{8} and others met you at Simla in connection with the release of pre-reform political prisoners who have already served 14 to 20 years of imprisonment. You have the power to get them released. G. Efforts should certainly be made to secure their release.{9} It is wrong to say that I alone have the power to get them out.",

He paid a tribute to the efforts of Lord Crewe to effect a settlement of the Asiatic question with the Transvaal Government, but he said that the concessions which had been made did not touch the vital principle of legal equality. Mr. Gandhi said he expected Hajee Habib and himself to be arrested on the Transvaal border. The campaign with which he was associated would, however, be continued most strenuously in India, the United Kingdom and South Africa, where Indian and English volunteers had organized a house-to-house visitation with the object of securing support and funds.",

      "fullContent": "June 22, 1937 The Associated Press special correspondent greeted Mahatma Gandhi early this morning today at his hut in Segaon village with a copy of Viceroy's message to India. Mahatma Gandhi who was having discussions with Seth Jamnalal Bajaj and other workers asked the correspondent to wait for a few minutes. In 15 minutes Mahatma Gandhi called in the correspondent, handed back the Viceroy's statement which was sent to him earlier by the correspondent and asked him to read it aloud for the benefit of himself and others present. Gandhiji attentively listened while the correspondent read the entire message slowly. At the conclusion of reading. Mahatma Gandhi asked the correspondent: Now, what do you want? On being told that his reactions on the statement were wanted, Mahatma Gandhi shrugged his shoulders and beckoned to the correspondent to take down. I have listened to the Viceroy's statement most attentively, but I am sorry that I cannot make any statement. The Working Committee will finally decide on July 5 on the grave issue that is before the country and I hope that no Congressman will want to anticipate the decision of the Working Committee and offer criticism. The conversation then turned to the Segaon village and village folk. Mahatma Gandhi said that the village had considerably improved and that there were better cows in the village than elsewhere in Wardha. People were healthy and they had plenty of fresh air even more than he because they were bold people, not sophisticated.",

      "fullContent": "November 9, 1933 Questioned whether he would issue a statement to the Press in connection with the all-India anti-untouchability tour, the Mahatma said that there was nothing to warrant a statement from him. All that he wanted to say in that connection had been said by him in his address at the Nagpur public meeting the previous night. He said he would be prepared to answer questions but warned them not to improvise questions.{1} Q.How many years do you think it will take for complete removal of untouchability at the present rate of progress ? A.It is more than I can answer. It is a question of a change of the hearts of millions of human beings. Q.Will you be prepared to receive swaraj before this curse is removed ? A.T he question is badly put. There is no meaning in asking whether I shall be prepared to receive swaraj if untouchability is not removed by then. Swaraj in not a matter of receiving or taking. It is one of evolution . We either grow to it from day to day or we go away from it. If we, as a nation, are becoming more and more conscious of ourselves if the fundamental unity of millions, then we are certainly progressing towards it. Whereas, if we are dissolving, then we are receding from it. Q. Do you not realize that the depressed classes have even now got their own superstitions and that they very much hesitate to associate with, for instance, Brahmins, even if the are asked to do so ? A.No, I do not; because, if what you say is true, it means that they want to remain in their present state of degradation. I cannot understand a social leper glorying in his leprosy. If the so-called de- pressed classes are so disgusted with the so-called high-class Hindus that they want absolutely to cut themselves adrift from Hinduism and Hindus, then they form a separate entity, which means they establish a new religion, or they accept any of the other prevailing religions of India. That is a thing which can happen, if the so-called higher classes continue to wallow in their imaginary superiority and do not perform the elementary duty of regarding the Harijans as their kith and kin. This anti-untouchability movement is an attempt to do this elementary duty by the Harijans. Q.Harijans seem to be unwilling to mix with caste-Hindus. Is it not a fact ? A.My experience is wholly different. I have talked with thou- sands of Harijans. They are eager to associate with the higher classes, if the latter behave themselves. What is true is that they distrust the higher classes, and where they do not distrust them, they are afraid of them. And there is this unfortunate additonal fact the the notion of inferiority from birth has been so much injected into them that they consider themselves doomed by God to eternal inferiority. This must be a matter of shame and humiliation for every thinking savarna Hindu.{2} The best way for the so-called caste Hindus was to forget that they were higher than anybody else. It was all a reflection of what was today a fact among the higher classes. It ought to cause no surprise to higher classes when they discover that there are differences in untouchability and therefore among untouchables.",

      "fullContent": "{1} June 5, 1917 I discussed with Mr. Gandhi this afternoon, Chief Secretary being present, the question of the step to be taken in connection with the Champaran situation. I explained to Mr. Gandhi that he had now had ample time to obtain all the information he needed, and that the raiyats were getting in an excited state, and it was ecessary in some way to put an end to a situation which was rapidly becoming a d angerous one. It is impossible for Mr. Gandhi himself to settle the questions which have been raised, as the planters would not recognise his authority; also for him to attempt to do so would be assuming the functions of Government. Government had intended to postpone their consideration of the points at issue until the settlement report had been received, but they recognise that, in present circumstances, this is no longer possible. It was decided, therefore, to appoint a Committee consisting of a senior revenue officer from another province (Mr. Sly) as President, and the following members:—Mr. Rainy, Deputy Secretary, Financial Department, Government of India; Mr. Adami, Legal Remembrancer; Mr. D. Reid, representative of the planters on the Legislative Council; Raja Harihar Prasad Narayan Singh of Amawan, as the representative of the zamindars; and Mr. Gandhi himself as the representative of the raiyats. The appointment of the last three gentleman, of course, could only be made with their consent, and I asked Mr. Gandhi if he would agree to serve. He said at first that he would prefer to remain outside the Committee, so that he might lead the evidence. But, after some discussion, he admitted that there were advantages in his being on the Committee, provided that it was recognised by Government that he had his own pronounced views which he might not readily change, and also that he would wish to place his own evidence before the Committee in the form of a written statement, on which the other members of the Committee would of course examine him. He also wished that he might be given freedom to produce witnesses for examination. I said that even if he were on the Committee, he would have as much freedom in these respects as if he had remained outside it. Mr. Gandhi then asked for time to consult Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, and promised to let me know his decision as soon as he had seen that gentleman at Bankipore. Mr. Gandhi agreed that the following terms of reference to the Committee were suitable, namely: “To enquire into the relations between landlord and tenant in the Champaran district as also into all disputes arising out of the manufacture and cultivation of indigo. The Committee to examine the material already available, supplementing it by such further enquiry, local and otherwise, as they consider desirable. They should report their conclusions to Government, if possible by the 15th October, and state the measures they recommend in order to remove any abuse or grievance which they might find to exist.” Mr. Gandhi asked if it might be taken as certain that the above terms of reference covered all the points I mentioned in his note of 13th May{2}, including the question of sharahbeshi sattas, although a case relating to them is pending in the High Court. I replied in the affirmative. Mr. Gandhi presumed that the term “material already available” would include any evidence which he might wish to tender. I again replied in the affirmative. Mr. Gandhi said that in his opinion the proceedings of the Committee should be of an informal and summary nature. I said I was inclined to agree but thought this might be left to the discretion of the Commissioners. Mr. Gandhi, on his part, undertakes at once to put a stop to his enquiry and to abstain henceforth from taking a single statement, and also from visiting any dehat or allowing any of his assistants to do so. Mr. Gandhi does not want the raiyats to feel that ‘A’ he has deserted them, and is unwilling on that account to leave the district altogether, pending the assembly of the Committee. But he undertakes not to go beyond Bettiah and Motihari; after short visits to these places, he will go on a visit to Ahmedabad. Mr. Gandhi asked that orders should issue at once putting a stop to illegal acts, such as the levy of abwabs and the impressment of labour. I said we could not do this unless at the same time we issued a notice which the planters asked us to issue, stating that Mr. Gandhi had no official recognition. Mr. Gandhi said he would be quite willing to see both statements made; but finally he agreed that in lieu of any such notice precise instructions should be issued to the local officers to take vigorous action to prevent all abuses that may come to light. For instance, the taking of abwabs must, as far as possible, be finally stopped, use being made where necessary of the power of refusing to renew leases. Similarly, the illegal impressment of labour, carts and ploughs must by all means be prevented wherever it comes to notice. Mr. Gandhi asked that warnings should be sent to planters not to impress carts or coolies or collect abwabs, etc., during the interval which will elapse before the report of the Committee is received. I replied that the planters would take offence, if Government were to issue such a warning, as it would imply a prejudging of their case, but said that when the planter-member of the Committee is appointed, I would point out to him the harm that would be done if such practices occurred, and ask him to consider the desirability of making such a communication to his brother-planters. The following action should now be taken:— (1) The Government of India should be informed briefly of the decision arrived at, and it should be mentioned that Mr. Tanner has been selected as Secretary instead of Mr. Tallents. (2) Mr. Reid and the Raja of Amawan should be asked if they will serve on the Committee. (3) A letter should be sent to the Commissioner informing him of the fact that it has been decided to refer the whole question of the agrarian conditions in Champaran to a Committee, the constitution of which will be communicated to him as soon as possible and that, meanwhile, Mr. Gandhi has agreed (as at ‘A’ above). The Planters’ Association should also be informed of the decision arrived at. (4) A short resolution to be drafted appointing the Committee, so that it may be issued as soon as possible after the constitution has been finally settled. E. A. G 5-6-1917 I have kept original draft signed by His Honour and altered by Mr. Gandhi. H. MCPHERSON{3}",

      "fullContent": "PANCHGANI, June 18, 1945 QUESTION: What did you mean when you said that the Desai Formula{1} had no such colouring as the Viceroy’s would seem to have, and how do you think that the Desai Formula would help to solve the communal tangle? ANSWER: Bhulabhai’s proposals have no colouring of caste. There is the 50 per cent basis as between two political bodies. If Bhulabhai’s proposals are the same as the Viceroy’s, then I am greatly mistaken. I did not read the proposals in that light. According to that Formula, if the Congress chose, it could appoint 50 per cent of any community, non-Hindus, caste Hindus and non-caste Hindus. If the Congress is obliged to choose only caste Hindus or even casteless Hindus then it ceases to be Indian National Congress. Asked if he was satisfied with the clarification offered by the Viceroy{2} and the Secretary of State{3} about the question of independence, he said that it was a question for the Working Committee to answer. He had his own opinion but he did not wish to anticipate or influence the Working Committee by speaking to the public. Q. What is your opinion about Lord Wavell’s personal efforts in solving the political deadlock? A. No one will know unless Lord Wavell chooses to write himself as to what part he has played in this connection. Q. What do you think about the omission of the Hindu Mahasabha? A. I have not thought over it, but as you prompt me I begin to think. I do not know whether it is the method of putting the Congress in the place of the Hindu Mahasabha and treating it as a sectional or a Hindu body and if it is that, which I hope it is not, the Congress will be one to avoid the whole show. But there is another construction also to be put upon that omission, namely, that the British Government wants to avoid the conference being based on religious distinction and, therefore, for examining the proposal they have invited political representatives only. Against this favourable assumption has undoubtedly to be put the parity between Muslims and caste Hindus. But I have publicly announced{4} that I believed that this mistake, however grave, is one of ignorance. If my assumption is right, the mistake would be corrected. Thinking along the same lines I account for the omission of the Muslim Majlis or the Jamiat-ul-Ulema and similar bodies. I must not also omit to mention that the composition of the conference is a very great advance upon all similar bodies, for, in all previous conferences convened by the British Government, members have been nominated by the Government principally. This time the members of the conference are under no obligation to the Government for their nomination and they need not vote or speak merely to placate the Government. The Congress Premiers, for instance, are under obligation only to the Congress as those belonging to the Muslim League are answerable only to the League. So far as I can recall there has been no such conference before. Q. Why do you think the Maulana was omitted in the first instance? A. Because the Viceroy thought that I represented the Congress and the people had given him cause to think so. But I must say the moment I pointed{5} out the mistake he saw it at once and rectified it.

      "fullContent": "{1} October 29, 1944 PROF. RANGA, You say that the earth rightly belongs or should belong to the peasant. By this, do you mean only that the peasant ought to gain control over the land he cultivates or that he should also gain effective voice and power in the society and over the State in which he is obliged to live? If the kisans are to have only land and not effective political power, their position will be just as bad as in Soviet Russia where political power has been monopolized by the proletarian dictatorship while peasants were first allowed to gain some holdings and later were deprived of those holdings in the name of collectivization of land. GANDHIJI: I do not know what has happened in Soviet Russia. But I have no doubt that if we have democratic swaraj, as it must be if freedom is won through non-violence, the kisan must hold power in all its phases including political power. Am I right in interpreting your statement that land should not belong “to the absentee landlord or zamindar” and that ultimately the zamindari system has to be abolished, of course through non-violent means? Yes. But you should remember that I visualize a system of trusteeship regulated by the State. In other words I do not want to antagonize the zamindars (and for that matter any class) without cause. When you say that a peasant “has so to work as to make it impossible for the landlord to exploit him” does it include, apart from the satyagrahic campaigns and the legislative and administrative reforms, that the peasants may oblige the State through the exercise of their franchise and political influence to improve their individual and collective conditions and minimize the powers of the landlords? Civil disobedience and non-co-operation are designed for use when people, i.e., the tillers of the soil, have no political power. But immediately they have political power, naturally their grievances, whatever their character, will be ameliorated through legislative channels. ‘But he might not have all that political power’, you will perhaps say. My reply is that if swaraj is attained by the effort of the whole people, as it must be under non-violence, the kisans must come into their own and have the uppermost voice. But if it is not so and there is a sort of a workable compromise between the people and the Government on the basis of a limited franchise, the interests of the tiller of the soil will need close watching. If the legislature proves itself to be incapable of safeguarding kisans’ interests they will of course always have the sovereign remedy of civil disobedience and non-co-operation. But as I said as early as in 1921{2} in connection with Chirala Perala, ultimately, it is not paper legislation nor brave words or fiery speeches, but the power of non-violent organization, discipline and sacrifice that constitutes the real bulwark of the people against injustice or oppression. You suggest that the existing kisan organizations should be reformed where necessary. I quite recognize the need for Congressmen who have been working among kisans to re-orientate the general political attitude of the kisan class organizations so that they will recognize the need for a united political leadership for winning our national freedom. I am also convinced that the National Congress provides for us all—especially for peasants—the most effective weapon and leadership to win freedom. But is there any harm if we organize peasants into a ‘Kisan Congress’ which accepts the political leadership of the Congress? There may be gross self-deception in this presentation. When I said that the Kisan Sabhas should be reformed, I meant that up till now Kisan Sabhas have been formed not to wrest power from the Government, but to capture the Congress. That applies to the student and labour organizations too. You are partially right. That was so in the past. But we have now completely abandoned that idea. Since you made your statement on the subject in 1938{3} the thing was completely given up. We have adopted the word Congress not in a spirit of rivalry but because we want to be identified with the Congress. We will have double membership. Every member of the Kisan Congress will also be enrolled as a member of the National Congress. Then why not run the Congress? Why set up an independent and parallel organization? Don’t you see when Kisan Sabhas are bona-fide organizations they are the Congress? Today only a fraction of India’s population is represented on the Congress register. The Congress aspires to represent the whole nation. It claims by right of service to speak even for those who are not on its register. When it becomes a fully national organization, de jure as it is today by moral right, the bulk of its membership will naturally consist of the kisans and they will be in a position to dictate its policy. The trouble is that some of our Congress colleagues think we are ousting them from their legitimate position of power and privilege. They may not be prepared to welcome our existence or trust our bona fides. We want to avoid conflicts within the Congress by willingly accepting the political leadership of the Congress. For executing our economic programme we want to have a separate class-conscious organization which will derive power both for itself and the Congress from its contact with the masses. Unless we do that, others will come and confuse the kisans. Here you have involved yourself in a fallacy. You should work to make the Congress fully representative of the kisans. Unless we get down to this fundamental thing and work from bottom upward, there will be no swaraj. Every Congressman must make up his mind to make the Congress an honest organization, and therefore a kisan organization. As for rights they should follow as a natural corollary from the performance of service. Otherwise, there is only usurpation. You have tried for the last twenty-five years to rebuild the Congress organization and you know the result. I along with others must plead guilty for my share in the responsibility for failure. I must confess we have not got the confidence that we shall be able to so behave and act that the Congress will in the end become a kisan organization. Our fear is that by following your line of action in spite of ourselves, we shall allow ourselves to be exploited by vested interests. The very fact that the Birlas and their like are today prepared to give you shelter and you accept it from them prevents radical reform. Therefore, though I shall feel the wrench, I shall feel unable to work on your lines. Then you admit that whilst you will work under the aegis of the Congress, you will at the same time run a parallel, independent organization. My mind runs in a straight line. I do not understand this zigzag. This can only lead to trouble when the Congress becomes an effective organization. I am thinking of the millions of our downtrodden countrymen who do not know what to hope and what not to hope. A parallel organization will only further confuse their minds. It would be more logical to keep out of the Congress altogether. We enter the Congress, but we do not fight for position and power. Can you not treat us on the same footing as the Ahmedabad Labour Union? Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. It will all depend on the spirit in which it is done. I have already expressed my apprehension. It is for you to remove it. You can model your organization after the Ahmedabad Labour Union. All the Labour Union members are on the Congress register. They are under the discipline of the Congress. Yet they are a power in the Congress and in the Municipality. You should confine yourself to Andhra alone. All kisans should be automatically on your register. But the purpose of enrolment should be educative, to make the kisans Congress-minded and politically conscious. I am glad you are laying special stress on adequate wages which will assure a minimum and decent standard of living for the landless peasants. Do you not also recognize the need for achieving minimum prices for agricultural produce which will assure labouring proprietors a decent and minimum standard of living? Of course I do. The Bombay A. I. C. C. Resolution assures the masses that the power in the national Government and swaraj India ought to belong to the toilers on the fields, in the factories and elsewhere.{4} Can we say that the spirit of the Resolution means that the Congress therefore stands for the achievement of democratic-kisan-mazdoor-praja raj after the attainment of swaraj? Not only after but before also. The Congress stands for democratic-kisan-mazdoor-praja raj. Do not your new instructions envisage the development of kisan organizations from the village upwards, to provide for peasant leadership and co- operative action, but working in harmony with the local National Congress Committee and their leadership? I may say that the Haripura session{5} of the Congress has recognized the right of kisans to have their own class organizations. But we are anxious, in the light of these four years’ experience, that Congressmen shall take the lead in organizing kisans into their own unions so that there can be real unity and co-operation between kisan organizations and Congress Committees. Kisan organization and Congress organization are to me convertible terms. National Congress organizations to be true have either to be kisan organizations or nothing else. Can we organize landless agricultural labour into their separate unions wherever there are workers to undertake such responsibilities in order to win for them the barest economic and social justice? I do not envisage such unions in rivalry with the local peasant unions but as a supplement to them. Yes, but as part of Congress reorganization work. Your instructions do not specifically mention the need for awakening and organizing the Hill Tribes and people of backward areas known as the Excluded or Partially Excluded Areas. These people number easily thirty million all over India and they are subject to many disabilities and they need our help very badly. May we take it that Congressmen have to spare their energies to organize these people into their unions? Certainly. The aboriginal is as backward as the Harijan and more neglected. He calls for all the humanitarian service that Congressmen are capable of. Unfortunately very few Congressmen have taken to it. Can our peasants and their organizations undertake satyagraha campaigns against any oppressive measures or policies of a landlord or a revenue authority, i.e., after all possibilities for settlement by negotiations through the good offices of the local Congress Committees have failed? We are aware of the 1939 Bombay A. I. C. C. instructions{6} regarding such campaigns and we accept that when there is a National Government with which the Congress co-operates, peasants’ unions as well as local committees have to seek the guidance of the Provincial Congress Committees as to when and how to start and conduct such satyagraha campaigns. They would be fools if they did not do that. What flag do you recommend for peasant unions and handloom weavers’ unions and such other unions which agree to accept the National Congress leadership? I may inform you that we have decided to drop the Red Flag and adopt the National Flag, with the typical class or professional emblem such as the plough or the loom placed in one corner in addition to the charkha which occupies already the central place. I don’t mind. To differentiate you can have your class emblem by the side of the national emblem. Do you not recognize the need for all the colonial peoples to try to come nearer to each other, learn from each other’s experience in their fight for freedom and help each other? “Colonial people” is a badly chosen expression, “oppressed races of the earth” expresses the idea better. “Colonial” in the English language means whites who have migrated to the Colonies. Are we right in thinking that your stand against world imperialism is intended to benefit as much the African, Chinese, Red Indians and other non-white masses as the 400 millions of India? My correspondence with the Government while under detention shows that most clearly. May we have your blessings for our attempt to build up the “Colonial Peoples’ Freedom Front” and thus develop a research, propaganda and ideological platform with merely advisory and informative functions? I may inform you that several of our friends and your admirers in England, Africa and the West Indies, such as Mr. Reginald Reynolds, Miss Stock Kenyatta, Mr. George Padmore, have already been working on your lines for the emancipation of the colonial and coloured peoples. I want to say ‘Yes’. But I want to understand its implications. The greatest social problem of the modern world is the exploitation of the vast masses of agricultural people by the industrial peoples and countries through the unequal exchanges imposed upon the former by the latter through their control over the world markets and finance and imperialist machinery. Are we right in thinking that you stand for the abolition of this process of exploitation of the producers of primary commodities and the agricultural masses of the world? Root and branch. Are we right in thinking that ours is only a part of the general struggle of colonial peoples against world capitalism and imperialism and that India is the vanguard in the world movement of colonial and agricultural masses for freedom, economic and political? I hope so. Is it not our duty to allow Congressmen to join and work in local food councils and such other quasi-official organizations now that every detail of a person’s life has come within the price-controls, grain procurement and requisition and acquisition and rationing activities of Government, provided we feel satisfied that we can render some effective help to our masses or prevent mischief? Yes. They ought to be allowed if they can do without loss of initiative and independence and can really render effective help. What shall those peasants do whose Gandhi-Irwin salt privileges have been unjustly withdrawn or curtailed? They should take the salt if it comes within the clause. Do you not recognize the need for students and their Students Congress to understand, popularize and act upon the ideology of the I.N.C. consistently with their responsibilities as students? Of course they should study and understand all that. I have set forth the limitations in my “Hints”.",

      "fullContent": "LONDON, October 13, 1931 I do not want to be aggressive. I maintain that the failure to discover a solution for the communal question is largely due to want of knowledge about the new constitution and also tot he unre- presentative character of delegates. The Government know only too well that the Congress is the only body which can deliver the goods. What then is the use of their pretending that the Congress is one among different groups, namely, Hindus, Depressed, Classes, Christians, landlords, zamindars? When the struggle was in progress the Hindu Sabha was not different from the the Congress. I am certain that a referendum is held today, the Hindus and Depressed Classes will by overwhelming majority be found to be in sympathy with the Congress. I am certian that the Nationalist Muslims will render a good account of themselves. If I had my own way, I certainly would surrender to the Muslims, but it will be of no use for the Government to exaggerate the differences which are largely due to the composition of the delegation which is their own action. If the Government is genuinely not in favour of framing a constitution prior to a communal settlement, I invite them to put their hand to the plough. I am prepared to co-operate with the Government on the minimum terms which the Congress is prepared to accept. The Congress insists on the fullest control of the army, foreign policy and finance. The Government have the choice to accept or reject the Congress demands. I do not expect the the Government to solve the Indian question at this Conference, but an participating in it in the fulfilment of the promise that I gave Lord Irwin to discuss every issue and I value the contacts outside the Conference more.

      "fullContent": "May 31, 1935 Answering several questions, Gandhiji said that plague was practically exterminated from Borsad. The conversation next turned to the village industries work. Asked as to why he selected Wardha as his headquarters Gandhiji said: Because Wardha is in the centre of India, and it was in Wardha that I was able to get a rich piece of land with buildings and plenty of water, land worth over two lakhs. There are nearly 700 fruit trees on the land. I selected Wardha also because Sheth Jamnalal Bajaj was most anxious that the land which he had contemplated as donation for Maganlal Gandhi Memorial should be taken up by the All-India Village Industries Association. Lastly, Wardha is a half-village and half-town, and my own desire and that of my associates was that the headquarters should not be selected in any presidency town. There was an additional attraction of Vinoba and his band of workers already trained at the Wardha Ashram. These were sufficient inducements for all of us for selecting Wardha as headquarters. Answering further questions, Gandhiji said that he did not propose to move out of Wardha as far as possible in order that the work might go on in his presence, as the conception was his. Moreover, it was advisable that all office-bearers of the Association should be in close touch with him and that he might be available, whenever any of them wanted his guidance at Wardha. They met daily for one-and-a- half hours except on Mondays. Asked as to whether it was a fact that he had left Gujarat because he was dissatisfied with her, Gandhiji said that that was altogether a wrong notice. It is not without considerable pain that I am just now physically cut off from Gujarat, though, in other respects, I am in constant touch with her work. Replying to another question, Gandhiji said that he wished he could stay in Gujarat for the Village Industries work, but he was afraid that Gujarat was far too commercialized for doing spade-work with better prospects of success than elsewhere. Gandhiji was of opinion that villages in Gujarat were more touched by that commercial spirit than elsewhere.",

Although Gandhiji was reluctant to express his opinion on the proposal, I had a long conversation with him from which it could be gathered that Gandhiji does not mind whether it be an enquiry or a tribunal, but what he really wants is the grant of the substance of his demand. He said: What is in a name? I would be satisfied with anything that gives me the substance. Gandhiji said that he would be satisfied if an enquiry on the lines indicated by Sir P.

      "fullContent": "{1} The special correspondent of the Swarajya writes from Ahmedabad: I interviewed Mahatmaji on the present situation, regarding the proposed truce{2}. QUESTION: What is the opinion of Lala Lajpat Rai and Motilal Nehru? ANSWER: As regards Motilalji, his opinion is contained in the latest issue of Young India{3}. Lalaji has asked me not to worry about those who are in jail. Suppose volunteer organizations arc not declared unlawful in other provinces and public meetings are not prohibited, then what should volunteers and Congress workers do, to get into jails? In their case civil disobedience can only be of an offensive nature. For this they should wait till I have launched upon it. Meanwhile, they must go on organizing the volunteers, must spin at least four hours a day, and produce at least one tola per hour, of even, twisted yarn of about 10 or 12 counts. Should the volunteers picket foreign cloth shops and liquor shops? They may be picketed by people who understand their responsibility, and do it peacefully. How long do you expect the struggle to continue in the new year? I don’t know. In the present state, it may not continue for more than two months. We must be prepared for indiscriminate flogging and shooting by the Government from all parts of India. We must not flinch even then. The present struggle is not so much to right the Punjab and Khilafat wrongs, much less for swaraj. We are now fighting for the elementary rights of free speech and freedom to form associations, and on this question we expect Moderates and others to be with us. When this intermediate skirmish will be finished, our way will be clear. Mahatmaji added that any swaraj scheme must include the control of the military and the police.

      "fullContent": "Interviewed by a Mercury representative, Mr. Gandhi said that at the meeting which followed his arrival with Mr. Kallenbach and Mr. Polak, thanks were expressed for the reception accorded them. His release, he added, was a surprise, and only when he was out of the prison did he learn that his release was due to a recommendation of the members of the Commission. We feel that our release throws a great responsibility upon our shoulders, and, on learning how the Commission is constituted, I feel that the fundamental fraud is that the Indian community was not consulted as to the nomination of the members. The spirit of the whole passive resistance struggle since 1907 has been that, in matters affecting the community, the Government should consult its opinion and sentiments. This the Government, apparently, have not done regarding the Commission, and therefore{1} there is objection to its nomination of itself. With reference to Mr. Esselen and Col. Wylie, Mr. Gandhi said he had the pleasantest recollections of both gentlemen, and had not the slightest doubt that they would discharge their duties on the Commission conscientiously, but he could not credit them with the superhuman qualities of divesting themselves of their anti-Asiatic views, which they were known to so profoundly hold. Now that they had been nominated members of the Commission, he would not object to their appointment, but it was due to the Indian community, he added, that the influence they might have on the findings should be counter-balanced by appointments from the European nationality known to possess no anti-Asiatic bias. Unless the Government accede to this reasonable request, it is not possible for us to accept this Commission or assist its deliberations. Unless the submission be accepted, we have decided not to give any evidence before them, and we shall resume activities in order to seek re-arrest and re-imprisonment. The Natal Mercury, 22-12-1913",

      "fullContent": "1. INTERVIEW TO V. S. SRINIVASA SASTRI . . . Dr. V. B. Gokhale came to me about 8-45 p.m. just as I was finishing my dinner; he told me how the Yeravda authorities had removed Mr. Gandhi to the Sassoon Hospital, where he was in charge. He was about to be operated for appendicitis. . . . On my entering the room, we greeted each other and I enquired how he felt as to the operation. He answered firmly that the doctors had come to a definite conclusion and he was content to abide by it, and in reply to further inquiry, he said that he had full confidence in the medical men about him and that they had been very kind and very careful. Should there arise any public agitation, he added that it should be made known that he had no complaint whatever to make against the authorities and that so far as the care of his body went, their treatment left nothing to be desired. Then I enquired if Mrs. Gandhi had been informed of his condition. He said that she did not know the latest development, but she knew that for sometime he had not been well and he expected to hear from her. He then made inquiries of my wife and of my colleagues in the Servants of India Society, viz., Messrs Devadhar, Joshi, Patwardhan and Kunzru. He asked: Have your frequent journeys out of India benefited your health? Doctor Phatak then read a draft statement to be signed by Mr. Gandhi conveying his consent to the operation. After hearing it once, Mr. Gandhi put on his spectacles and read it himself. Then he said he would like the wording to be changed and asked Col. Maddock who was in the room what he thought. The Colonel said Mr. Gandhi knew best how to put it in appropriate language. His own suggestion would be of much value. Then he dictated a lengthy statement{1} which I took down in pencil. When it was finished, I read it out to him once. Then he called Col. Maddock to his side and I read it again at his desire. Col. Maddock was quite satisfied and remarked: “Of course you know best how to put in proper language.” He then drew up his proper posture for signing the paper, which he did in pencil. His hand shook very much and I noticed that he did not dot the “i”. At the end he remarked to the doctor: See how my hand trembles. You will have to put this right. Col. Maddock answered: “Oh ! We will put tons and tons of strength into you.” As the operation room was being got ready, the doctors went out and I found myself nearly alone with the Mahatma. After a remark or two of a purely personal nature, I asked him whether he had anything particular to say. I noticed a touch of eagerness as he replied as though he was waiting for an opportunity to say something. If there is an agitation for my release after the operation, which I do not wish, let it be on proper lines. My quarrel with the Govern-ment is there and will continue so long as the originating causes exist. Of course, there cannot be any conditions. If the Government think they have kept me long enough, they may let me go, that would be honorable if they think I am an innocent man and that my motives have been good. While I have a deep quarrel with the Government, I love the Englishmen and have many friends amongst them. They may release me. But it must not be on false issues. Any agitation must be kept on proper, non-violent lines. Perhaps, I have not expressed myself quite well, but you had better put it in your own inimitable style. I then pressed him again for a message to his people, his followers or the country. He was surprisingly firm on this subject. He said he was a prisoner of Government and he must observe the prisoner’s code of honour scrupulously. He was supposed to be civilly dead. He had no knowledge of outside events and he could not have anything to do with the public. He had no message. “How is it then that Mr. Mahomed Ali communicated a message as from you the other day?” The words were scarcely out of my mouth when I regretted them, but recall was impossible. He was obviously astonished at my question, and exclaimed.: Mr. Mahomed Ali ! A message from me !{2} Briskly, at this point, the nurse came in with some articles of apparel for him, and signalled to me to depart. In a few minutes, he was shifted to the operation room. I sat outside marvelling at the exhibition I had witnessed of high-mindedness, forgiveness, chivalry and love transcending ordinary human nature, and what a mercy it was that the non-co-operation movement should have had a leader of such serene vision and sensitiveness to honour. . . . . . I have read out this statement to Dr. Phatak who approves of it and adds that his inquiry as to a message elicited the same sort of answers. The Hindu, 14-1-1924",

      "fullContent": "BOMBAY June 16, 1934 In the afternoon Dr. Ambedkar interviewed Gandhiji along with Dr. Solanki and other friends{1} of his. Gandhiji asked Dr. Ambedkar for a criticism of the work of the Harijan Sevak Sangh. The worthy Doctor suggested that the Sangh might economize on education and medical relief, as these were attended to by Government and there was a risk of duplication of effort in these matters. Again, education, in the first place, only benefited the individual; whether it would benefit society or not would depend upon what attitude the educated individual took up towards society. He would like the Sangh to concentrate on the primary object of securing full civic rights for Harijans, such as the right to draw water from public wells and to send children to public schools, without any discrimination being exercised against them. As regards cases of maltreatment of Harijans by villagers, such as those adduced by Dr. Ambedkar, Gandhiji said the Sangh was bound to deal with them. In fact, steps had actually been taken in numerous cases with more or less success. But in future Gandhiji would be glad if the Doctor was good enough to send him full facts about every incident of that description. In course of his tour of villages he had noticed that a change for the better was coming over them, but progress in that direction would be accelerated if he had the Doctor’s valued co-operation. As regards education, Gandhiji did not think there was overlapping. In fact, the Sangh was unable to cope with the whole demand, as the right type of teachers were not readily available.",

Asked whether he had finally decided to go to the London Conference and when he was likely to start, Gandhiji said that the Working Committee would decide all those questions for him. His theory and views had been exploded and he would willingly obey whatever the Committee asked him to do. Asked whether the situation in Gujarat was satisfactory, after hesitating for a while, Gandhiji replied that the situation was not satisfactory. But he had been corresponding with the Government of India. Incidentally, he mentioned that he had been receiving reports from all over India forwarded by reliable trusted workers like Mr. C. Rajagopalachari, that a deliberate policy of repression of strictly peaceful picketing, in the shape of faked prosecutions, physical interference and lathi charges was hindering the working of the Settlement. None of these complaints had escaped his attention, and he could not publish them as he was carrying on delicate negotiations with the Central Government from and through which he expected to gain relief. He hoped that things would not assume serious proportions as to endanger the Truce. He had one word to say to Congressmen, that the safety and honour of the Congress demanded meticulous performance by the Congressmen of all the conditions of the Truce. Gandhiji proposed to place the Working Committee in full possession of all the complaints. Gandhiji profoundly regretted the failure of the efforts in Bhopal to effect a settlement between the two sections of the Muslim group. It was a very unfortunate incident. The Working Committee would discuss what next should be done in view of the failure. Gandhiji was confident that the Foreign-cloth Export Scheme would prove a success and the scheme did not amount to a breach of the Truce as alleged by certain interested parties. Is the contention made by a new political school of thought to the effect that the Congress, by accepting the Truce, accepted the principle of Federation as enunciated in the last R.T.C. true? If so where does the Congress resolution of Indepcndence passed at the Lahore Congress and reiterated at Karachi stand? A. This question need not be answered.",

      "fullContent": "{1} DELHI, {2} Gandhiji remarked on the presence of divisions among them. They admitted divisions but argued that they were there even in Gandhiji’s time. GANDHIJI: The difference between then and now is this: that in those days the black-legs became isolated after a time, and it was possible to hold monster meetings everywhere. Parsi Rustomji went among the indentured labourers and, in the final struggle, they rose like one man. Repeat that history today, and you will win. Do not repeat it, and you will fail. Do you command the sympathy and support of all the interests? Will the mercantile community back you? SORABJI: The mercantile community was not with us even then. But we had Cachalia{3} . If you have one Cachalia amongst you, the whole of the merchantile community will be covered. S. Suppose no merchant comes forward. Is not a struggle possible then? G. It will then take a different turn and in the end the mercantile community will be swept out of existence. A MEMBER: We are a difficult community at times. ANOTHER MEMBER: And quarrelsome too. G. I know, I know. The South Africa of today is not far different from the South Africa that I have known. In the first article I wrote for the Indian Opinion I said that if after all there was one true man in South Africa, he will cover all. He will build up the whole structure from within. ‘Amidst a whole heap of bad coins’, I wrote, ‘If there is one true sovereign, the heap will be worth that one sovereign and no more.’ If you produce one civil resister of merit, he will pull things through. Do not start the struggle, therefore, unless you have that stuff. Manage to exist you will anyhow. But that should not satisfy you. You have to live as a self- respecting community with an equal status. Indians have to make good that position by showing the real stuff. The discussion then turned on the strategy of the proposed satyagraha. Gandhiji was definitely opposed to sitting in prohibited seats in trains and railway carriages by way of satyaraha. Satyagraha should be on a clear, unequivocal and impersonal issue and capable of taking thousands in its fold. . . . Gandhiji mentioned how he had refused to send a measage for a meeting of the West Africa Federation that was held some time back in London, because they conceived of a struggle after the way of Europe. He added: Probably theirs is not the way of non-violence. One day the black races will rise like the avenging Attila against their white oppressors, unless someone presents to them the wepon of satyagraha. A MEMBER : You have said, we should associate with Zulus and Bantus. Does it not mean joining them in a common anti-white front? GANDHIJI: Yes, I have said that we should associate with Zulus, Bantus, etc. It means that you take them under your wing when you have developed that power of non-violence. It will be good, if you fire them with the spirit of non-violence. You will be their saviour. But if you allow yourselves to be overwhelmed and swept off your feet, it will be their and your ruin. Their slogan today is no longer merely ‘Asia for the Asiatics’ or ‘Africa for the Africans’ but the unity of all the exploited races of the earth. On India rests the burden of pointing the way to all the exploited races. She won’t be able to bear that burden today, if non-vio-lence does not permeate us more than today. I have been try-ing to fit ourselves for that mission by giving a wider bend to our strug-gle. India will become a torch- bearer to the oppressed and exploited races, only if she can vindicate the principle of non-violence in her own case, not jettison it as soon as independence of foreign control is achieved. ANOTHER MEMBER: Race consciousness is arising all over South Afria. We Indians take advantage of the Bantus. We send our children to Native colleges. But we are ashamed to call ourselves Natives. They feel we are arrogant and aloof. We do not do enough to make an adequate return for what we have got from them. They are getting resentful and the white man encourages and promotes that feeling to widen the gulf. G. It will be an evil day for you, if he succeeds. The trouble is that you are all worshippers of the golden calf. Christopher: Having never seen it, how can we worship it? G Worshipping is different from seeing. Don’t we worship God without seeing Him? The delegation then asked, if a leader could be sent from India to organize and lead them. Gandhiji, in reply, told them that a leader would have to arise from among them. He hoped that they would throw up one in due time. He described to them how he had been arguing with his son Manilal to train up his children for the task. After they had finished their education in India, he hoped, they would go back and settle down in South Africa and serve the Indian comminity. Apropos the training that would equip South Africa born Indian children for service, he mentioned how he had refused to send his own children to Loveday and Fort Hare.",

      "fullContent": "GORAKHPUR{1} DELHI, October 30, 1924 The policy that the Government has lately adopted in Bengal has distressed all. The distress is natural. It is not, however, owing to the lawlessness of policy; it is owing to our inability to give it a prompt reply. I hope and I want that we shall not lose patience at this critical juncture. I firmly hold that by becoming angry or impatient we shall not find the right remedy. Action can only be answered with action. And I dare say that we can answer the Government’s policy of violence only by a policy of non-violence; we can answer its violent action only by non-violent action. If this is true we have to consider what non-violent action we can undertake. On a little reflection we see that the biggest obstacle in the way of any practical work that we can do is the schism between Hindus and Muslims. The obstacle to our bringing the common people together is our indifference to the charkha and khadi; and untouchability is a thing that is ruining the Hindu society. So long as we have not rid ourselves of this threefold sin our portion can only be, in my humble opinion, Government lawlessness, slavery and poverty. I can, therefore, offer no other counsel to the nation. If we can achieve these three aims, we can demonstrate a strength even fiercer than what we showed in 1920-21. Then we can remove the misery not only of Bengal but of the whole of India. MOHANDAS GANDHI",

      "fullContent": "{1} As my arrest may come upon me unawares, I wish to leave the following as my message. I appeal to all my countryrnen and countrywomen throughout India to observe absolute calmness and to refrain from violence to person and property in any shape or from. The greatest injury that can be done to me is deeds of violence after my arrest and for my sake. Those who love me will show their true affection only by becoming satyagrahis, i.e., believers in Truth and ahimsa (non- violence) and self-suffering as the only means for securing redress of grievances. To the Government of India, I respectfully wish to submit that they will never establish peace in India by ignoring the causes of the present discontent. Satyagraha has not bred lawlessness and violence. It is a vital force and it has certainly hastened the crisis that was inevitable. But it has also acted as a restraining force of the first magnitude. Government as well as the people should recognize this fact and feel thankful for it. Without the purifying and soothing effect of satyagraha, violence would have been infinitely greater, for mutual retaliation would have produced nothing but chaos. Mahomedans are deeply resentful of what they believe to be England’s attitude towards the question of Turkey, Palestine and Mecca Sharif. The people are deeply distrustful of England’s attitude towards the forthcoming Reforms and they want repeal of the Rowlatt legislation. No repression can possibly avail to secure even a shadow of peace in the land. Substantial peace can only be had by conciliating Mahomedan religious sentiments by granting reforms in a liberal and trusting spirit, even as was done by the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman in the case of South Africa and by recognizing the sacredness of public opinion by immediate repeal of the Rowlatt legislation. But the British Government all the world over have demanded proof of a people’s earnestness. The chosen European method of expressing earnestness is to create disorder by violence. The Government have given a crushing reply to this method. It may prosper in Europe, but not in India. To satyagraha, there can be no reply but that of acceding to satyagraha demands. Government of a country is possible when people support it by contributing revenue, by filling public services and such like actions symbolic of approval. When a Government does justice, i.e., is broadbased upon the will of a people, such support is a duty in spite of its temporary aberrations. Withdrawal—total or partial—of such support becomes equally a duty when Government is carried on in defiance of people’s will and such withdrawal of support is pure satyagraha when it is unaccompanied by violence in any shape or form and unadulterated by untruth. Satyagrahis, then, knowing the sanctity and invincibility of satyagraha will not lend themselves to violence and untruth and will refrain from offering civil disobedience until they are assured that there will be no violence on the part of the people, whether such a state of things was brought about by the peoples’ willing acceptance of the doctrine of Truth and non-violence or by the military dispositions of the Government. In the former case, the whole of India will have participated in the joy of satyagraha and will have given a lesson to the world. In the latter case, the Government will realize that no physical force that they can summon to their aid will ever bend the spirit of satyagrahis.",

      "fullContent": "DEAR SISTERS, I have been thinking all this time about the kind of message I should send to you on my birthday, which falls today. What interest can our sisters have in my birthday? What is the reason that they know me? Pondering on this question, I feel that they do so because they recognize my love for them. They know that I value their honour and that I have shown the best means of safe guarding it. This means is swadeshi. In following swadeshi, women can do much more than men. When, in the past, the daughters of India spun and clothed themselves and others, India may have been poor but she was not as abject as she is today. It is plain to me that today the women in the country are unable to preserve their virtue as they could do in the old days. I, therefore, once again put before them the same idea. All women should devote at least one hour daily to spinning Realizing that simplicity is dharma, women should regard them selves adorned through it, regard as sacred whatever quality of cloth is produced from yarn spun by girls and wear such cloth for the purpose of covering their bodies. I see, too, and I want women as well to see, that this is the only way to win swaraj. The best way to show our regard and affection for a person is to follow his example. My aim in everything which I ask my countrymen to do is to revive tile satyayuga{1}. Our first task in the country is to educate women. Education will help them to safeguard their virtue. For doing this what we require is not much erudition but strength of character. The love you have shown me today encourages me to ask you to show love of another kind by resolving to bring back the satyayuga. India is certainly capable of defending herself. If we decide to use exclusively cloth made in India we shall in a very short time haveensured strong protection for the country. That is why I am trying to popularize the spinning-wheel. It enables women to safeguard their virtue. There is no other occupation which will help millions of our women to spend their time usefully sitting at home. To ply a spinning-wheel does not require much of intelligence either. The country should learn to be self-reliant. It will be so when it has brave men and brave women. The courage we should display is of the kind required in satyagraha, which is superior to the courage of arms. If we can do this, we are bound to be free. Save the millions of rupees which are drained out of the country and protect your sisters. If you are convinced that the work I am asking you to do needs to be done, come forward, for the sake of the country, to take it up. 1. Go among the poor and, wherever you find people suffering for want of food and clothing, introduce the spinning-wheel, banish hunger and help people to become self-supporting. 2. Wherever you find the surroundings very dirty, women and children disease ridden and the general state one of moral laxity, the people should be provided with the means for a sober, clean, healthy and pure life and, in this way, be made aware of their present condition and ways of living. 3. Wherever you see the need for efforts to spread knowledge and a desire to undertake such efforts, you should provide the necessary means and should, yourselves, work actively. For this work, it is first necessary to cultivate self-purification, that is, spiritual growth, sisterly regard for others and intellectual humility. There is, thus, an excellent and fruitful field of work for the Bhagini Samaj{2}, if the Samaj would take it up. The field is so large that, if it does solid work, seemingly bigger tasks will count as nothing by comparison and great service will have been rendered to the cause of Home Rule without the phrase being so much as even mentioned. In the past, when there were no printing presses and few facilities for public speeches, when we could cover 24 miles in as many hours instead of a thousand as now, there was only one effective means of propagating ideas, namely, one’s work. Today, we rush from place to place with the speed of air, deliver speeches and write articles, and yet we find it almost impossible to persuade people to act as we want them to. From every direction we hear words of despair. To me it is clear that, as in the past, so in the present too we shall not succeed in impressing the people with speeches and writings as effectively as we can with work. It is my humble prayer to the Bhagini Samaj that it should attach the first importance to quiet work. It is a huge waste if, from all these books which people read, nothing is put into practice. Try, therefore, to act upon at least an ounce of what you read in books rather than attempt to read a ton load of them. I do not want to name the many sciences there are in the world, but it is safe to believe that you have grasped the meaning of any science to the extent that you put it into practice. It is not proper that we pay no attention to acting on the numerous pledges that we take. Any pledge once taken should be scrupulously kept, at the cost of one’s life if necessary. Let your life be governed by high ideals. In Rome, the ideals themselves changed, but in India we have Still not forgotten ours. Whether Hindus or Muslims, we are all heirs to our forefathers. We can hope to preserve that heritage only by constantly fixing our attention on high ideals of life. With our forefathers, aspiration for goodness was the central motive of their life, but it seems to have vanished from us. Wherever we turn, we find hypocrisy. We have got into the habit of resorting to lies in every small matter. We must root that out and fill our lives with truth. Your humble brother, MOHANDAS KARAMCHAND GANDHI",

      "fullContent": "” {1} The only message that I have for men and women of India, but more especially for the latter, is that of the spinning-wheel. The non- violent movement is one to enable the weakest of human beings to vindicate their dignity without an earthly protector. Woman has been regarded as weakness personified. She may be weak in body, but she can be as strong in soul as the strongest. The spinning-wheel, with all its implication, is the weapon, in India at least, of the strong in soul. The universal adoption of that wonderful wheel robs Great Britain of her purely selfish interest in India. It is only then possible for the connection between India and England to become pure and predomi- nantly unselfish, and therefore, for the good of the world. May the women of India adopt hand-spinning as a part of their daily duty, and take their full share in the struggle for the freedom of the weakest in body of our country.

The brunt of the battle must, therefore, fall upon their shoulders. I pray to God that He may give you sufficient strength to bear it. You have discharged yourselves brilliantly hitherto. Remember that we are descendants of Prahlad{3} and Sudhanva, both passive resisters of the purest type. They disregarded the dictates even of their parents, when they were asked to deny God. They suffered extreme torture rather than inflict suffering on their persecutors.

      "fullContent": "A gentleman has asked me some searching questions, which, being important, I give below :{1} If the Antyaja members cannot stay where the other members of the conference lodge, certainly it cannot be said that untouchability has been eradicated. Our Antyaja brethren should have the liberty to do all that the other four castes can do. It is their duty to refuse to stay where the Antyaja members cannot stay. SECOND QUESTION{2} Just as members of other communities sit in one row with due regard for decorum, so should Antyajas be able to do as a matter of right. This volunteer did well when he politely got up and took another seat on being criticized by a Vaishnava. Good manners require that those who are in a large gathering should yield to the sentiments of the majority. If, in this particular incident, the correspondent yielded to the request of one so-litary Vaishnava, his conduct deserves especial commendation. It is not right for us to force others to conform to our views. Our dharma is to protect and serve Antyajas. We should, therefore, share such of their hardships as we cannot relieve. THIRD QUESTION{3} When at every step we find injustice being done, we may help in stopping as much of it as we can. However we act, we are bound to do injustice in one way or another and therefore, when we must make a choice from among several courses, we should choose that which would do the least injustice. FOURTH QUESTION{4} Anyone who thinks or acts unworthily will find some reason for doing so. If I did not visit the Antyaja localities, I would not be able to meet all of them. In a public meeting they can get no opportunity of pouring out their hearts. In visiting their localities there is also the desire to stress the need for internal reform among them. The aim behind admitting Antyajas to public meetings is to make people accept their presence. We cannot ignore either of these aims. Wherever, therefore, a public meeting is held from which Antyajas are kept out, I should adopt it as a general rule not to address it. If the incident reported by this volunteer to have taken place at Amreli{5} did take place, it is a painful thing. The thought that Antyajas should be prevented from attending meetings in Gaekwar’s Baroda State, and that too in Amreli, is unbearable. “If the sea catches fire, how can we put it out?” I, however, realize from the example of Amreli the need for greater vigilance on my part.

      "fullContent": "For some time you seem to have made it a point to strengthen your arguments in favour of non-violence by frequent but invariably vague references to the Holy Koran and the teachings of Islam. It is quite obvious that you only seek to impress the Muslims thereby. . . . Similarly, it is quite understandable that you should pat the fifth columnist Mussalmans like Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Abul Kalam Azad on the back. But can’t you realize that nothing can offend the religious susceptibilities of a Mussalman more than to see a non-Muslim citing the scripture for his own purpose? . . . The fact stands out that you are a non-Muslim. Hence the Koran cannot be the source of your ideas or ideals. . . . It is my friendly advice to you to stop forthwith all reference to the Koran. . . . This letter{1} is from an M.A. (Aligarh). He is a research scholar in the Muslim University. The letter was received some time ago. I kept it in my file so long, for I was debating whether it would serve the cause of unity to publish it. But having received another from the same friend more unbalanced than this one, I decided to publish the foregoing in order to enable me to expostulate with those who in Aligarh or outside hold views similar to the writer’s. I have sweet memories of Aligarh. I have more than once visited the great university. I have still associations with it. I think I am an honorary member of their club. I received{2} the honour at the hands of the late Dr. Sir Ross Masood when he was Vice-Chancellor of the university. As for the Holy Koran, it was my Muslim clients and friends in South Africa who invited me to read it. They furnished me with Islamic literature. On my return to India, Muslim friends sent me copies of translations of the holy book. Among the senders was Dr. Mahomed Ali, himself a translator, and the late Mr. Pickthall, also a translator of the book. I was presented by the late Hakim Saheb Ajmal Khan with Maulana Shibli’s translation. Have I changed or have the times so changed that it has become a crime for a non-Muslim like me to read and even dare to put his own interpretation upon the Koran? Many pious Muslims have remarked that I am a better Muslim than most Muslims in that I act in the spirit of the Koran and know more of the life of the Prophet than most Muslims. Whose testimony am I to accept—these Muslim friends’ or the research scholar’s and of those who think like him—I wonder. The research scholar is right in imputing to me the desire to read my meaning into the Koran. Surely there is no harm in it so long as I remain absolutely faithful to the text and approach my task with a prayerful and open mind. My correspondent should know as a scholar that an interpretation of a life or a book is not necessarily correct because it has been handed down for generations. An error does not cease to be one after a given number of repetitions by a given number of men for a given number of years. The Biblical texts are still being corrected. And many good Christians believe that the Christianity of the West is a negation of Christ’s central teaching. It is just possible that the research scholar’s views about the qualifications required for reading and interpreting the Koran and his own interpretation are wrong, and that my being a non-Muslim is no bar to my reading the Koran or interpreting it. And it is not at all impossible that my interpretation may be found to be right. It will be an evil day if the reading and interpreting of religious books are to be confined only to those who wear particular religious labels. I ask my correspondent and his companions, as their friend, to shed what in my opinion is their gross intolerance and give the same credit to others for seeing truth as they claim for themselves. No one has a monopoly of truth. All truth represented by imperfect humans that we are is relative. We can each act according to our lights. God alone knows the reality. That being so, it behoves research scholars at least to be humble and tolerant. Fanaticism and intolerance can neither conduce to research work nor advance the cause they represent.

      "fullContent": "A friend who is a student of non-co-operation has asked me some questions which I reproduce here as they are of interest to many: Q. Our opposition is directed not against individuals but against a “system”. Then what does “system” mean—mobilization, tradition or culture? A. Certainly, it is not mobilization. Tradition, yes; also culture to the extent that it is responsible for tradition. Q. In the article entitled “Rabbi May” in Young India,{1} you write that, through the injustice meted out to Sir Sankaran Nair, the wickedness of this regime has been further exposed. You write to the members of the Indian national Congress: “If the Government courts and schools attract us and yet we oppose them, then our opposition is not against a system but against individuals . . . My swaraj consists in maintaining intact the spirit of our culture .” Considering these two extracts, we find it suggested in the first that the government is under the control of the whites, while the second one contains a dig at our culture. A. That is not so at all. Even if there had been an Indian judge in the Sankaran Nair case, he would have dealt him similar injustice. Since the judge was a supporter of the present policy of the British Government, he could give no other judgment. We in India know from experience that, at critical junctures, we cannot expect justice from Indian judges working under the current administration. The fault is not theirs but that of the system. An ordinary man cannot transcend his environment. He who can transcend it will not work a moment under such an unacceptable system. Non-co-operation teaches us this very principle. I have often said that, if the adminis- tration is to continue according to the current system, it would be unacceptable to me even if every official is an Indian. Q. It is my impression that the scheme of non-co-operation was devised not to protect our culture—protection of culture may well be its indirect though, in a sense, very important result—but to maintain our self-respect. A. Since the attack on our self-respect was obvious, it was more effective to give prominence to it. But our self-respect was the basis of our culture. Now, when we see the danger of fascination exercised by courts, schools, etc., despite the fact that the respect due to us has not been restored as yet, we expose the veiled attack on our culture. Such successive arguments, of course, are not deliberately advanced. Circumstances give rise to them. If we go deep into the subject, we are able to see that words like honour, culture, system, etc., have a close relationship to one another and that all of them have a common origin. Q. I am not sure whether there is anything really harmful in Government courts and yet I would not lodge there a complaint against my neighbour because they are the courts of an alien Government which oppresses us. Likewise, he who does not see any defect in the present educational system should also boycott it. Even if the medicines to be had at a Government hospital are very good or even if the police arrangements are praiseworthy, the non-co-operator should not take the benefit of these. A. Those who see nothing wrong in the courts and schools except that they are run by an alien Government find it difficult to non-co-operate. What is wrong in these institutions is not their being run by an alien Government, but their being a part of a faulty system. But here a definition of system is called for because the questioner has used the word “educational system”. I see defects even in the educa- tional system of the Government. But that is not the reason for my opposition. My opposition is to the system of Government adminis- tration. It is the system in which the financial interest of the rulers is dominant and in which religion or morality, call it what you will, has a minor place. It is the system in which the rulers do not hesitate to employ Dyerism in order to protect their economic interests and are not afraid of committing any sin. If the system were not so selfish, there would have been no reason to call the British Government alien. The truth of this argument may be tested thus: Suppose this Govern- ment feels sorry for the Punjab massacre, stops the import of foreign cloth, encourages khadi, forgoes the income from opium and liquor, reduces its military expenditure by 75 per cent, regards the promotion of Hindu-Muslim unity as its duty and respects public opinion in other ways; then who will oppose it? And if anyone does so, who will listen to him? Even if they are defective in other respects, we shall not boycott the existing courts and schools. This kind of selfishness in Government administration or system is at the very basis of modern or Western culture. But the Government’s Dyerism, etc., which are the manifest results of that culture, are sufficient to rouse opposition even in those who do not wish to think thus deeply over the matter. Q. You write: “The aim of the Government’s policy is to Anglicize us. The moment we get Anglicized, our English rulers will hand over the reins of Government to us and accept us as their agents.” Have the Englishmen been here with such an unselfish motive? They loudly proclaim as a virtue what you regard as a fault in them. Will the Englishmen quit if we adopt the European system? Even then, how can we become their voluntary agents? Do not conflicts arise between England and Germany even though they have a common culture? I should say that conflicts arise precisely because their culture is common. A. Many issues are involved in this question. If we become Anglicized we shall certainly cease to be wearers of khadi. Modern culture is, in effect, materialistic and opposed to the claims of atman. By becoming Anglicized, we shall be adopting a system of exploiting all others in the world. Then we shall be indifferent to the condition of farmers and make brute force the basis of our existence. In that case, military expenditure, etc., will remain unchanged. If that happens, they will have nothing to say against us. When our wants considerably multiply, we shall be England’s biggest customers and, consequently, its willing retailers, that is, agents. That England and Germany fought with each other is also a result of that same culture brought about in a different way. Both wanted to exploit weak nations and both wanted the largest share; hence the conflict. But there is a big difference between that fight and our fight. Theirs was a confrontation of equals, so there was no ques- tion of self-respect. We, of course, are conscious of our self-res-pect every moment. Once we adopt the culture of Europe, there will be no possibility of a conflict between Englishmen and us as long as we remain the customers of England. Englishmen repeatedly tell us that we are not yet fit to manage our own affairs; this is far from being absolute hypocrisy. Many believe and say that as long as our culture remains distinct, we shall not be qualified to carry on Government in accordance with the European system. How is it that South Africa, etc., have complete autonomy? Observers may see for themselves that since the whites there swear by the same culture, they have become England’s agents. England sells its goods through those whites, hence it has no need to post its own men there. No one should believe that the same blood flows in their veins. If the whites of South Africa would now turn selfless and give first priority to the interests of the Negroes, England would feel embarrassed and worried despite the fact that the former are whites. Our experience tells us that, when some Englishmen adopt such a selfless attitude, English society boycotts them.",

      "fullContent": "I have been overwhelmed with public criticism and private advice and even anonymous letters telling me exactly what I should do. Some are impatient that I do not advise immediate and extensive non-co-operation; others tell me what harm I am doing the country by throwing it knowingly in a tempest of violence on either side. It is difficult for me to deal with the whole of the criticism, but I would summarize some of the objections and endeavour to answer them to the best of my ability. These are in addition to those I have already answered :{1} 1.The Turkish claim is immoral or unjust and how can I, a lover of truth and justice, support it? 2.Even if the claim be just in theory, the Turk is hopelessly incapable, weak and cruel. He does not deserve any assistance. 3.Even if Turkey deserves all that is claimed for her, why should I land India in an international struggle? 4.It is no part of the Indian Mohammedans’ business to meddle in this affair. If they cherish any political ambition, they have tried, they have failed and they should now sit still. If it is a religious matter with them, it cannot appeal to the Hindu reason in the manner it is put and in any case Hindus ought not to identify themselves with Mohammedans in their religious quarrel with Christendom. 5.In no case should I advocate non-co-operation which in its extreme sense is nothing but a rebellion, no matter how peaceful it may be. 6.Moreover, my experience{2} of last year must show me that it is beyond the capacity of any single human being to control the forces of violence that are lying dormant in the land. 7.Non-co-operation is futile because people will never respond in right earnest, and reaction that might afterwards set in will be worse than the state of hopefulness we are now in. 8.Non-co-operation will bring about cessation of all other activities, even working of the Reforms, and thus set back the clock of progress. 9.However pure my motives may be, those of the Mussulmans are obviously revengeful. I shall now answer the objections in the order in which they are stated : 1.In my opinion the Turkish claim is not only not immoral and unjust, but it is highly equitable, if only because Turkey wants to retain what is her own. And the Mohammedan manifesto has definitely declared that whatever guarantees may be necessary to be taken for the protection of non-Muslim and non-Turkish races, should be taken so as to give the Christians theirs and the Arabs their self-government under the Turkish suzerainty. 2.I do not believe the Turk to be weak, incapable or cruel. He is certainly disorganized and probably without good generalship. He has been obliged to fight against heavy odds. The argument of weakness, incapacity and cruelty one often hears quoted in connection with those from whom power is sought to be taken away. About the alleged massacres{3} a proper commission has been asked for, but never granted. And in any case security can be taken against oppression. 3.I have already stated that if I were not interested in the Indian Mohammedans, I would not interest myself in the welfare of the Turks any more than I do in that of the Austrians or the Poles. But I am bound as an Indian to share the sufferings and trials of fellow-Indians. If I deem the Mohammedan to be my brother, it is my duty to help him in his hour of peril to the best of my ability, if his cause commends itself to me as just. 4.The fourth refers to the extent Hindus should join hands with the Mohammedans. It is therefore a matter of feeling and opinion. It is expedient to suffer for my Mohammedan brother to the utmost in a just cause and I should therefore travel with him along the whole road so long as the means employed by him are as honourable as his end. I cannot regulate the Mohammedan feeling. I must accept his statement that the Khilafat is with him a religious question in the sense that it binds him to reach the goal even at the cost of his own life. 5.I do not consider non-co-operation to be a rebellion, because it is free from violence. In a larger sense all opposition to a Government measure is a rebellion. In that sense, rebellion in a just cause is a duty, the extent of opposition being determined by the measure of the injustice done and felt. 6.My experience of last year shows me that in spite of aberrations in some parts of India, the country was entirely under control, that the influence of satyagraha was profoundly for its good and that where violence did break out there were local causes that directly contributed to it. At the same time I admit that even the violence that did take place on the part of the people and the spirit of lawlessness that was undoubtedly shown in some parts should have remained under check. I have made ample acknowledgment of the miscalculation I then made. But all the painful experience that I then gained did not in any way shake my belief in satyagraha or in the possibility of that matchless force being utilized in India. Ample provision is being made this time to avoid the mistakes of the past. But I must refuse to be deterred from a clear course, because it may be attended by violence totally unintended and in spite of extraordinary efforts that are being made to prevent it. At the same time I must make my position clear. Nothing can possibly prevent a satyagrahi from doing his duty because of the frown of the authorities. I would risk, if necessary, a million lives so long as they are voluntary sufferers and are innocent, spotless victims. It is the mistakes of the people that matter in a satyagraha campaign. Mistakes, even insanity, must be expected from the strong and the powerful, and the moment of victory has come when there is no resort to the mad fury of the powerful but a voluntary, dignified and quiet submission—but not submission to the will of the authority that has put itself in the wrong. The secret of success lies therefore in holding every English life and the life of every officer serving the Government as sacred as those of our own dear ones. All the wonderful experience I have gained now during nearly 40 years of conscious existence, has convinced me that there is no gift so precious as that of life. I make bold to say that the moment the Englishmen feel that, although they are in India in a hopeless minority, their lives are protected against harm not because of the matchless weapons of destruction which are at their disposal, but because Indians refuse to take the lives even of those whom they may consider to be utterly in the wrong, that moment will see a transformation in the English nature in its rela-tion to India, and that moment will also be the moment when all the des- tructive cutlery that is to be had in India will begin to rust. I know that this is a far off vision. That cannot matter to me. It is enough for me to see the light and to act up to it, and it is more than enough when I gain companions in the onward march. I have claimed in private conversations with English friends that it is because of my incessant preaching of the gospel of non-violence and my having successfully demonstrated its practical utility that so far the forces of violence, which are undoubtedly in existence in connection with the Khilafat movement, have remained under complete control. 7.From a religious standpoint, the seventh objection is hardly worth considering. If people do not respond to the movement of non- co-operation, it would be a pity, but that can be no reason for a reformer not to try. It would be to me a demonstration that the present position of hopefulness is not dependent on any inward strength or knowledge, but it is hope born of ignorance and superstition. 8.If non-co-operation is taken up in earnest, it must bring about a cessation of all other activities including the Reforms, but I decline to draw therefore the corollary that it will set back the clock of progress. On the contrary, I consider non-co-operation to be such a powerful and pure instrument, that if it is enforced in an earnest spirit, it will be like seeking first the Kingdom of God and everything else following as a matter of course. People will have then realized their true power. They would have learnt the value of discipline, self- control, joint action, non-violence, organization and everything else that goes to make a nation great and good, and not merely great. 9.I do not know that I have a right to arrogate greater purity for myself than for our Mussulman brethren. But I do admit that they do not believe in my doctrine of non-violence to the full extent. For them it is a weapon of the weak, an expedient. They consider non-co- operation without violence to be the only thing open to them in the war of direct action. I know that if some of them could offer successful violence, they would do today. But they are convinced that, humanly speaking, it is an impossibility. For them, therefore, non-co- operation is a matter not merely of duty but also of revenge. Whereas I take up non-co-operation against the Government as I have actually taken it up in practice against members of my own family. I entertain very high regard for the British constitution. I have not only no enmity against Englishmen but I regard much in English character as worthy of my emulation. I count many as my friends. It is against my religion to regard anyone as an enemy. I entertain similar sentiments with respect to Mohammedans. I find their cause to be just and pure. Although therefore their view-point is different from mine I do not hesitate to associate with them and invite them to give my method a trial, for I believe that the use of a pure weapon even from a mistaken motive does not fail to produce some good, even as the telling of truth, if only because for the time being it is the best policy, is at least so much to the good.",

      "fullContent": "{1} {2} QUESTION: In the Bhagavad Gita comes a sloka{3}: . . . If everything goes according to fixed law, then if you pray to God, can He intervene and set aside the law for your sake? ANSWER: But the meaning at the bottom is: “Thy will be done, not mine.” God’s law is never interrupted, but that very law says that every act has its result. In the prayer for the child, father surrenders his will to God. The law works as if it were a person, and since every action tells, this prayer has an unforseeable result. You should work out what I have written. The sum total of every act is a resultant. Draw a parallelogram of forces. Jnana, karama and bhakti—should not they all go together? Unless you know God, how can you have bhakti? You cannot even offer him your karma. You must not reason like this. If you have no work and so- called bhakti, the result will be lop-sided. Do you know God to whom you pray? I don’t. He is unknown to you and me. To whom shall we then pray? To God, whom you do not know. We always do not know the person to whom we are praying. But the Shastras say that He is knowable. Since He is knowable we search. It may take a billion years. Even if you do not believe, you must continue to pray.“Help thou mine{4} unbelief”{5} is a verse from the Bible. But it is improper for you to ask such questions. For you, there must be infinite patience and inward longing. Inward longing obviates all such questions. “Have faith and you will be whole”{6} is another chip from the Bible. Gita has many such parallel passages. Q.When I look at nature around me, I say to myself there must be one Creator, one God and to Him I should pray. A. That is reasoning. God is beyond reason. But I have nothing to say, if your reason is enough to sustain you.",

      "fullContent": "The following letter comes from a friend : In the Harijan dated 30-9-1939, on page 1 at the end of your article{1}, you write: “Speed is not the end of life. Man sees more and lives more truly by walking to his duty.” And then you subscribe: “On the train to Simla”. I am surprised that, with all the fund of humour you possess, you could not see how the words “On the train to Simla” pointed the finger of ridicule to the statement “Man sees more and lives more truly by walking to his duty.” Time was when this friend used to believe in my method and was a valuable supporter. Somehow or other I have now fallen from grace. He should have had no difficulty in following the rich humour behind the writing which he exposes to ridicule. But I must deprive the ridicule of its sting by informing my friend that I was in my senses when I wrote the note referred to. I might easily have avoided the exact place where it was penned. But I wanted to add point to my remark and to discover to the reader the vast gulf that separates me from my ideal. Let the waverers take heart from the fact that though my note containing the flat contradiction of the ideal has provided my friend with mirth, I have got the credit for trying my best to live up to the ideals, I may profess. If I am to make an ever-increasing approach to my ideal, I must let the world see my weaknesses and failures so that I may be saved from hypocrisy and so that even for very shame I would try my utmost to realize the ideal. The contradiction pointed out by the friend also shows that between the ideal and practice there always must be an unbridgeable gulf. The ideal will cease to be one if it becomes possible to realize it. The pleasure lies in making the effort, not in its fulfilment. For, in our progress towards the goal we ever see more and more enchanting scenery. Coming, however, to the friend’s gibe let me tell him and the reader that I could pen those lines because it is never a pleasure to me to travel by motor or rail or even a cart. It is always a pleasure to walk. Nor should I mind in the least if every rail was removed and men, except the sick and the maimed, had to walk to their businesses. I can not only imagine but am working for a civilization in which possession of a car will be considered no merit and railways will find no place. It would not be for me an unhappy event if the world became once more as large as it used to be at one time. Hind Swaraj was written in 1909{2}. Since then it has undergone many editions and has been translated in many languages of the world. I was asked last year by Shrimati Sophia Wadia to write a foreword{3} for the edition that she was bringing out. I had the pleasure, therefore, of having to re-read it carefully. The reader may know that I could not revise a single idea. I had no desire to revise the language. It is a fair translation of the original in Gujarati. The key to understand that incredibly simple (so simple as to be regarded foolish) booklet is to realize that it is not an attempt to go back to the so-called ignorant, dark ages. But it is an attempt to see beauty in voluntary simplicity, poverty and slowness. I have pictured that as my ideal. I shall never reach it myself and hence cannot expect the nation to do so. But the modern rage for variety, for flying through the air, for multiplicity of wants, etc., have no fascination for me. They deaden the inner being in us. The giddy heights which man’s ingenuity is attempting, take us away from our Maker who is nearer to us than the nails are to the flesh which they cover. Therefore even whilst I am travelling at the rate of 40 miles per hour, I am conscious that it is a necessary evil, and that my best work is to be done in little Segaon containing 700 souls, and in the neighbouring villages to which I can walk. But being a highly prac- tical man I do not avoid railway travelling or motoring for the mere sake of looking foolishly consistent.{4} Let the reader know that during the hurricane Harijan tours{5} that Thakkar Bapa had arranged for me I had gently suggested to him that I would like to do the whole of the years’s tour on foot. He would not listen. And we had violent demonstrations during the tour. Twice or oftener we escaped serious injury and it might have been even death. When we reached Puri{6}, there was fear of bloodshed. So I put my foot down and insisted on performing the remaining pilgrimage on foot. Thakkar Bapa readily consented.{7} Well, the demonstrators who were prepared only for demonstrations by rail and motor could not overtake the pilgrims who covered only 8 to 10 miles per day in two stages. This was the most effective part of our tour. The awakening was solid. Our experiences were rich. And the demonstrators had no excitement left for them. They had no desire to kill me in cold blood. They were out for sensations. Sensations are not to be had with non-violent men and women walking to their mission without any fear of man and in the certain knowledge of having God as their infallible Guide and Protector.

      "fullContent": "Sardar Sardul Singh is an esteemed worker. His open letter advising me to invite sympathetic civil disobedience for Bardoli demands a reply especially because it enables me to clear my own position. If Bardoli Satyagraha were a campaign of lawlessness as the Government paint it, nothing would be more tempting or more natural than sympathetic satyagraha and that too without the limits prescribed in the Sardar’s letter. But the Sardar rightly says: I find in prominent Gujarat workers a tendency to allow Bardoli peasants to be kept isolated. This impression has been created in my mind by the reports of Sjt. Vallabhbhai’s speeches and your writings. Friends think that any more scruples on this point go beyond the limits of practical politics. The Sardar’s impression is correct. In order strictly to limit the scope of the struggle to the purely local and economic issue and to keep it non-political Sjt. Vallabhbhai would not let Sjt. Rajagopala- chari and other leaders to go to Bardoli. It was only when the Govern- ment gave it a political character and made it an all-India issue by their coercive measures that the reins were loosened and Vallabhbhai could no longer prevent public men from going to Bardoli, though where his advice or permission was sought, he said, “Not yet.” I do not know what Sjt. Vallabhbhai Patel would say to the Sardar’s suggestion but I can say, “Not yet.” Time has not come even for limited sympathetic satyagraha. Bardoli has still to prove its mettle. If it can stand the last heat and if the Government go to the farthest limit, nothing that I or Sjt. Vallabhbhai can do will stop the spread of satyagraha or limit the issue to a bona-fide re-inquiry and its logical consequences. The limit will then be prescribed by the capacity of India as a whole for self-sacrifice and self-suffering. If that manifestation is to come it will be natural and incapable of being stayed by any agency no matter how powerful. But so far as I understand the spirit of satyagraha and its working, it is the duty of Sjt. Vallabhbhai and myself to keep to the original limits in spite of the Government provocations which are strong enough even as they are to warrant the crossing of the original boundary. The fact is that satyagraha presupposes the living presence and guidance of God. The leader depends not on his own strength but on that of God. He acts as the Voice within guides him. Very often therefore what are practical politics so-called are unrealities to him, though in the end his prove to be the most practical politics. All this may sound foolish and visionary on the eve of what bids fair to become the toughest battle that India has hitherto had to face. But I would be untrue to the nation and myself if I failed to say what I feel to be the deepest truth. If the people of Bardoli are what Vallabhbhai believes them to be, all will be well, in spite of the use of all the weapons that the Government may have at its command. Let us wait and see. Only let the M.L.C.s and others who are interested in compromises not take a single weak step in the hope of saving the people of Bardoli. They are safe in the hands of God.",

      "fullContent": "{1} {2} I have been asked by Sir S. Radhakrishnan to answer the following three questions: (1) What is your religion? (2) How are you led to it? (3) What is its bearing on social life? My religion is Hinduism which, for me, is religion of humanity and includes the best of all the religions known to me. I take it that the present tense in the second question has been purposely used instead of the past. I am being led to my religion through Truth and Non-violence, i.e., love in the broadest sense. I often describe my religion as religion of Truth. Of late, instead of saying God is Truth I have been saying Truth is God, in order more fully to define my religion. I used at one time to know by heart the thousand names of God which a booklet in Hinduism gives in verse form and which perhaps tens of thousands recite every morning. But nowadays nothing so completely describes my God as Truth. Denial of God we have known. Denial of Truth we have not known{3}. The most ignorant among mankind have some truth in them. We are all sparks of Truth. The sum total of these sparks is indescribable, as-yet-Unknown Truth, which is God. I am being daily led nearer to it by constant prayer. The bearing of this religion on social life is, or has to be, seen in one’s daily social contact. To be true to such religion one has to lose oneself in continuous and continuing service of all life. Realization of Truth is impossible without a complete merging of oneself in and identification with this limitless ocean of life. Hence, for me, there is no escape from social service; there is no happiness on earth beyond or apart from it. Social service here must be taken to include every department of life. In this scheme there is nothing low, nothing high. For all is{4} one, though we seem{5} to be many. Contemporary Indian Philosophy, p. 21",

But I have seen from experience that our love for the beloved one is not for his or her body but the immortal spirit dwelling in it. As the years pass, your memory of your wife will not grow dim in your heart, but will become stronger and richer.

If God wills to take some service from you through this very body of yours, He will save your life. T HE B EST U SE OF THE A SHRAM The Satyagraha Ashram has been permanently given away for Harijan work. I feel that this is the best use it can be put to. Since the Government did not take possession of it, there was no other equally good purpose for which it could have been used. This was also the best way of sacrificing the Ashram. Having regard to the ideals of the Ashram, everybody here feels that this is the best purpose for which it could be used. A special committee will be appointed to run it. It will not admit just any Harijan. Whoever is admitted will have to abide by the rules of the place. I see nothing wrong in the Ashram inmates being without a permanent abode and living anywhere contented with whatever comes their way. When everything is over, we may set up another Ashram; that is the only proper course for us. Q UESTIONS FROM A H ARIJAN W ORKER{4} I do not believe that many Harijan workers are taking more than what they need for their subsistence. Some of them take nothing at all. I do not know what is ‘fat salary’ according to you. I consider him the best propagandist who takes only enough for his food and cloth- ing. In our poor country we do not have a leisured class which would provide us national workers.",

      "fullContent": "With certain omissions I quote below the following{1} from a highly educated sister : You have shown the world, through ahimsa and satyagraha, the dignity of the soul. . . . But just as there is need for ahimsa and brahmacharya for a man to get rid of his aggressive spirit, lust . . ., etc., there is for woman need of certain principles that would enable her to get rid of her baser qualities, which are different from men’s and commonly said to belong by nature to her. The natural qualities of her sex, the upbringing meted out to her because of her sex, and her environment which is created because of her sex, all are against her. And in her work these things, namely, her nature, upbringing and surroundings always get in the way and hinder her and give occasion for the hackneyed phrase, ‘She is only a woman, after all’ . . . I think that, if we only possess the correct solution, the correct method of improving ourselves, we could make our natural qualities, such as sympathy and tenderness, a help instead of a hindrance. The improvement just as your solution in the case of men and children, must come from within us. . . . Your advice to me was to read Harijan. I do so eagerly. But so far I have not come across, well, the advice for the inner spirit. Spinning and fighting for the national freedom are only some aspects of the training. They do not seem to contain the whole solution. For I have seen women who do spin and do try to work out the Congress ideals and still commit blunders which are attributed to the fact of their being women. . . . . Tell us, please, how to make the best use of our qualities, how to turn our disadvantages into advantages. . . . I had flattered myself that my contribution to the woman’s cause definitely began with the discovery of satyagraha. But the writer of the letter is of opinion that the fair sex requires treatment different from men. If it is so, I do not think any man will find the correct solution. No matter how much he tries, he must fail because nature has made him different from woman. Only the toad under the harrow knows where it pinches him. Therefore ultimately woman will have to determine with authority what she needs. My own opinion is that, just as fundamentally man and woman are one, their problem must be one in essence. The soul in both is the same. The two live the same life, have the same feelings. Each is a complement of the other. The one cannot live without the other’s active help. But somehow or other man has dominated woman from ages past, and so woman has developed an inferiority complex. She has believed in the truth of man’s interested teaching that she is inferior to him. But the seers among men have recognized her equal status. Nevertheless there is no doubt that at some point there is bifurcation. Whilst both are fundamentally one, it is also equally true that in the form there is a vital difference between the two. Hence the vocations of the two must also be different. The duty of motherhood, which the vast majority of women will always undertake, requires qualities which man need not possess. She is passive, he is active. She is essentially mistress of the house. He is the bread-winner, she is the keeper and distributor of the bread. She is the caretaker in every sense of the term. The art of bringing up the infants of the race is her special and sole prerogative. Without her care the race must become extinct. In my opinion it is degrading both for man and woman that women should be called upon or induced to forsake the hearth and shoulder the rifle for the protection of that hearth. It is a reversion to barbarity and the beginning of the end. In trying to ride the horse that man rides, she brings herself and him down. The sin will be on man’s head for tempting or compelling his companion to desert her special calling. There is as much bravery in keeping one’s home in good order and condition as there is in defending it against attack from without. As I have watched millions of peasants in their natural surroundings and as I watch them daily in little Segaon, the natural division of spheres of work has forced itself on my attention. There are no women blacksmiths and carpenters. But men and women work on the fields, the heaviest work being done by the males. The women keep and manage the homes. They supplement the meagre resources of the family, but man remains the main bread-winner. The division of the spheres of work being recognized, the general qualities and culture required are practically the same for both the sexes. My contribution to the great problem lies in my presenting for acceptance truth and ahimsa in every walk of life, whether for individuals or nations. I have hugged the hope that in this woman will be the unquestioned leader and, having thus found her place in human evolution, will shed her inferiority complex. If she is able to do this successfully, she must resolutely refuse to believe in the modern teaching that everything is determined and regulated by the sex impulse. I fear I have put the proposition rather clumsily. But I hope my meaning is clear. I do not know that the millions of men who are taking an active part in the war are obsessed by the sex spectre. Nor are the peasants working together in their fields worried or dominated by it. This is not to say or suggest that they are free from the instinct implanted in man and woman. But it most certainly does not dominate their lives as it seems to dominate the lives of those who are saturated with the modern sex literature. Neither man nor woman has time for such things when he or she is faced with the hard fact of living life in its grim reality. I have suggested in these columns that woman is the incarnation of ahimsa. Ahimsa means infinite love, which again means infinite capacity for suffering. Who but woman, the mother of man, shows this capacity in the largest measure ? She shows it as she carries the infant and feeds it during nine months and derives joy in the suffering involved. What can beat the suffering caused by the pangs of labour ? But she forgets them in the joy of creation. Who again suffers daily so that her babe may wax from day to day ? Let her transfer that love to the whole of humanity, let her forget she ever was or can be the object of man’s lust. And she will occupy her proud position by the side of man as his mother, maker and silent leader. It is given to her to teach the art of peace to the warring world thirsting for that nectar. She can become the leader in satyagraha which does not require the learning that books give but does require the stout heart that comes from suffering and faith. My good nurse in the Sassoon Hospital, Poona, as I was lying on a sick bed years ago{2}, told me the story of a woman who refused to take chloroform because she would not risk the life of the babe she was carrying. She had to undergo a painful operation. The only anaesthetic she had was her love for the babe, to save whom no suffering was too great. Let not women, who can count many such heroines among them, ever despise their sex or deplore that they were not born men. The contemplation of that heroine often makes me envy woman the status that is hers, if she only knew. There is as much reason for man to wish that he was born a woman as for woman to do otherwise. But the wish is fruitless. Let us be happy in the state to which we are born and do the duty for which nature has destined us. SEGAON, February 12, 1940",

      "fullContent": "A high educational officer who wishes to remain unknown has sent me, through a common friend, an elaborate and considered criticism of my plan of primary education. For want of space I may not reproduce the whole argument here. Nor is there anything new in it. And yet it deserves a reply, if only for the pains the writer has bestowed on his paper. This is how my suggestions have been paraphrased by the writer: (i) Primary education should start and end with training in crafts and industries, and that whatever may be necessary by way of general information should come in as auxiliaries in the initial stage, and that formal training through the medium of reading and writing in subjects like History, Geography and Arithmetic come right at the end. (ii) Primary education should be self-supporting from the first, and that this should and could be achieved by the State taking over the finished articles coming from the schools and selling them to the public. (iii) Primary education should be fully up to the Matriculation standard— less of course English. (iv) Prof. K. T. Shah’s idea of conscripting young men and women to teach in the primary schools should be fully examined and, if possible, acted upon.{1} The writer at once proceeds to say: If we analyse the above programme it seems to us that the underlying ideas are in some cases mediaeval, and in some cases based upon assumptions which would not bear examination. Probably No. iii is a very high standard. It would have been better if, instead of paraphrasing, the writer had quoted my own words. For all the statements in the first paraphrase are wide of the truth. My point is not that the start should be made with crafts and the rest should come in as auxiliaries. On the contrary I have said that the whole of the general education should come through the crafts and simultaneously with their progress. This is wholly different from what the writer imputes to me. 1 do not know what happened in the Middle Ages. But I do know that the aim in the Middle Ages or any age was never to develop the whole man through crafts. The idea is original. That it may prove to be wrong does not affect the originality. And an original idea does not admit of a frontal attack unless it is tried on a sufficiently large scale. To say a priori that it is impossible is no argument. Nor have I said that the formal training through the medium of reading and writing should come right at the end. On the contrary the formal training comes in at the very beginning. Indeed it is an integral part of the general equipment. I have indeed said, and I repeat here, that reading may come a little later, and writing may come last. But the whole process has to be finished within the first year, so that at the end of the first year in the school of my imagination a seven-year-old child, boy or girl, will have much more than the general information that any boy or girl has in the present primary school during the first year. He will read correctly and draw correct letters instead of making the daubs that the children generally do at present. The child will also know elementary additions and subtractions and the simple multiplication table. He will have learned all this through and while he has learned a productive craft, say spinning, by choice. The second paraphrase is just as unhappy as the first. For what I have claimed is that education through handicrafts should be self-supporting during the sum total of seven years I have assigned for it. I have specifically said that during the first two years it may mean a partial loss. Mediaeval times may have been bad, but I am not prepared to condemn things simply because they are mediaeval. The spinning- wheel is undoubtedly mediaeval, but seems to have come to stay. Though the article is the same it has become a symbol of freedom and unity as at one time, after the advent of the East India Company, it had become the symbol of slavery. Modern India has found in it a deeper and truer meaning than our forefathers had dreamt of. Even so, if the handicrafts were once symbols of factory labour, may they now be symbols and vehicles of education in the fullest and truest sense of the term. If the Ministers have enough imagination and courage, they will give the idea a trial in spite of the criticism, undoubtedly well- meant, of high educational officers and others especially when the criticism is based on imaginary premises. Though the writer has been good enough to assume the possibility of Prof. K. T. Shah’s scheme of conscription being sound, he later on evidently repents of it. For he says: The idea of conscripting teachers is to our mind an outrage. We should have in schools, where young children assemble, men and women who have voluntarily dedicated their lives to this profession so far as such a dedication is possible in this world, and who will bring sun-shine and zeal. We have made far too many experiments with our young men and women, but this one bids fair in its results to land us in a ruin from which there will be no escape for at least half a century. The whole thing is based on the notion that teaching is one of those arts for which no adequate training is necessary and that everyone is a born teacher. How a man of K. T. Shah’s eminence comes to hold it is inexplicable. The idea is a freak idea bound to be tragic in results if applied. Again, bow can each and everyone train children in handicrafts, etc.? Prof. Shah is well able to defend his proposition. But I would like to remind the writer that the existing teachers are not volunteers. They are hirelings (the word is used in its natural sense) working for their bread and butter. Prof. Shah’s scheme does contemplate possession of patriotism, spirit of sacrifice, a certain amount of culture, and training in a handicraft, before they are taken up. His idea is substantial, quite feasible, and deserves the greatest consideration. If we have to wait till we have born teachers, we shall have to wait till the Judgement Day for them. I submit that teachers will have to be trained on a wholesale scale during the shortest term possible. This cannot be done unless the services of the existing educated young men and women are gently impressed. It will not be unless there is a general willing response from that body. They responded, however feebly, during the civil disobedience campaign. Will they fail to respond to the call for constructive service against maintenance money? Then the writer asks: (1) Are we not to allow for a great deal of wastage in raw materials when handled by little boys? (2) Are the sales to be effected by a central organization? What about the cost of this? (3) Are the people to be compelled to buy at these stores? (4) What about the cases of those communities which are at present manufacturing these? What will be the reaction on these? My answers are: 1. Of course there will be wastage, but there will be even at the end of the first year some gain by each pupil. 2. The State will absorb much of the material for its own requirements. 3. Nobody will be compelled to buy the nation’s children’s manufactures, but the nation is expected to buy with pardonable pride and patriotic pleasure what its children make for its needs. 4. There is hardly any competition in the products of village handicrafts. And care will be taken to manufacture things which do not come into unfair competition with any indigenous manufacturers. Thus khadi, village paper, palm gur and the like have no competitors.",

      "fullContent": "Whilst I was at Lucknow the sub-editor of the Indian Daily Telegraph handed me some interrogatories for my answer. They are rather interesting. I therefore reproduce the most important of them with my answers. 1. Do you propose to launch mass civil disobedience within one year, or within any specified time? I entertain no present hope of being able to launch mass civil disobedience within any measurable distance of time. 2. Do you believe in the dictum ‘the end justifies the means’? I have never believed in the dictum. 3. A year ago it was reported that you intended to launch civil disobedience, and once launched you would go on with it, even if sporadic violence occurred. Absolute non-violence being impossible on the part of the masses, will you now take the risk of a modicum of violence (minimum, so far as it lies in your power) and launch civil disobedience? What I said a year ago and what I wish to repeat now is that whatever step I may take now will be, I hope, not conditional, but absolute and irrevocable. Whenever I have suspended civil dis- obedience I have done so not by reason of any outbreak of violence, but upon the discovery of such violence as had been initiated or encouraged by Congressmen who should have known better. Any outbreak of violence would not have brought about suspension, as, for instance, the Moplah outbreak. But Chauri Chaura did for the simple reason that persons connected with the Congress were involved in it. 4. In the Calcutta riot case, you laid the blame at the door of the Hindus. The Marwari Association or some Hindu organization challenged your verdict and produced evidence to prove the guilt of the Muslims in giving sufficient cause for provocation to the Hindus. You promised to publicly modify your verdict if you found your previous opinion mistaken. Will you now publicly modify your previous verdict? I have seen nothing to modify my previous verdict. 5. You have consented to accept address from the Municipal Board (which is now in the hands of the Swarajist Party), but you have avoided address from the Hindu Sabha. Why do you make this invidious distinction against a body which represents the Hindu community, to which you belong? I have never avoided address from the Lucknow Hindu Sabha. On the contrary, I told them that I would gladly accept their address when I paid a visit to Lucknow. The Swarajist Municipality approa- ched me later and pressed me to accept its address even whilst I was passing through Lucknow. The Hindu Sabha might have done likewise. There was no question of avoidance. I simply thought that the Sabha would not want to present me with an address whilst I was merely passing through Lucknow specially as the Sabha had desired to discuss with me the Hindu-Muslim tension in Lucknow. It will be remembered that I gladly accepted the Hindu Sabha address in Sitapur. 6. The Aminabad Park arati-namaz question is hanging fire for more than a year. Will you kindly give your decision, if both parties promise to abide by it? I have dealt with this matter in my U.P. Notes. 7. As a Hindu what is your candid opinion about the question? I have no opinion, as I do not know the facts. If I had made up my mind beforehand, I could not consent to arbitrate even if both the parties were willing to abide by my award. 8. Hindus never object to Muslim music during Moharrum, or at any time. Why should Muslims object to Hindu music? Are the Hindus not entitled to safeguard their religious rights by every means? This question deals with two questions of fact about which I know nothing. As to the third part of the question, Hindus are entitled to defend their religious rights not by every means but by every truthful and, in my opinion, non-violent means. 9. At Patna two kidnapped Hindu girls were produced before you. As a Hindu, what steps do you advise the Hindus to take against the growing evil of kidnapping throughout India? I dealt with this delicate question last week.{1} 10. Are not the Hindus justified in organizing themselves, not for any aggressive action against Muslims or others, but for safeguarding their re- ligious rights and stamping out such evils as kidnapping, etc., as also for the physical, social, moral and material advancement of the Hindu community? I do not suppose anybody can possibly object to the organization such as the question mentions. I certainly do not object. 11. Maulana Shaukat Ali sent a message through you to the Bihar Khilafat Conference. If Lala Lajpat Rai or Pandit Malaviya send a message through you to a Hindu Conference, will you have any objection to it? Maulana Shaukat Ali never sent through me any message to the Bihar Khilafat Conference; but if he had, I would certainly have carried any message from him, provided it was unobjectionable. And I should certainly carry out a similar commission entrusted to me by Pandit Malaviyaji or Lala Lajpat Rai.",

      "fullContent": "I am a humble student of philosophy and so I thoroughly appreciate the movement for the removal of untouchability which has hindered the progress of a large portion of mankind. I can also appreciate the way of penance by fast, but there is one difficulty in my way. You know that the Bhagavad Gita has said, “What the great ones do, the others follow”, and if a great soul like you set the example of fasting, is there no danger of others blindly imitating you, and quoting your example in support? Then again, you talk of the inner voice, and everybody will claim to speak in the name of the inner voice, and it will be held responsible for mixed marriages, mixed dinners, and consequent disruption of society. And when such reckless indiscipline takes place in the name of the inner voice, how would you propose to raise the level of the ordinary men, especially of untouchables? I must confess that I have considerably abridged the original which is fairly long. But I am sure that the substance of the correspondent’s argument has not in any way been lost in the abridgment. My answer is simple. I accept the teaching of the Gita verse that the correspondent has quoted. Surely, it was meant to warn leaders against conduct that might, if copied, result in harm to society. It cannot possibly apply to conduct whose intelligent imitation can do no harm. For if it did, it would mean an end to all progress and the setting of good examples. There is no such thing in human affairs as insurance against all danger. There is always danger of even the most irreproachable conduct being misinterpreted and misapplied, but the right thing has got to be, and has always been, done, in spite of the risk of misinterpretation and misapplication. I hold my fast to have been wholly good and obligatory on me. If the whole of mankind imitated the fast subject to all its conditions, no harm could result. A fast that was calculated to affect a big movement for the better could not be given up because of the fear of some people abusing it. Penitential fasting is admittedly a good institution. And lastly, fasting is its own safeguard against abuse. Not many people would be willing to fast, and much fewer still would be able to do so, even though they might be willing. Much the same may be said about the inner voice. Nobody has to my knowledge questioned the possibility of the inner voice speaking to some, and it is a gain to the world even if one person’s claim to speak under the authority of the inner voice can be really sustained. Many may make the claim, but not all will be able to substantiate it. But it cannot and ought not to be suppressed for the sake of preventing false claimants. There is no danger whatsoever if many people could truthfully represent the inner voice. But, unfortunately, there is no remedy against hypocrisy. Virtue must not be suppressed because many will feign it. Men have always been found throughout the world claiming to speak for the inner voice. But no harm has yet overtaken the world through their short-lived activities. Before one is able to listen to that voice, one has to go through a long and fairly severe course of training, and when it is the inner voice that speaks it is unmistakable. The world cannot be successfully fooled for all time. There is, therefore, no danger of anarchy setting in because a humble man like me will not be suppressed and will dare to claim the authority of the inner voice, when he believes that he has heard it. Unbridled licence is undoubtedly in the air. Everywhere one sees unrest, whether in the religious field or any other. The spirit of independence is abroad. Youth has always been found to be most impressionable and, therefore, it has naturally fallen a prey to this spirit; and in its haste to realize independence it has missed the central fact that independence can only come out of interdependence and that it is a fruit of long training in self-restraint. It has forgotten that independence is never synonymous with indulgence. The blame for the wildnesses of youth lies, therefore, at the door of the spirit of the times. It would be wrong to impute it to the assertion of sterling independence based upon a conscious practice of self-restraint and an ever-increasing effort implicitly to obey the will of God speaking within and then known as the inner voice. It is now, perhaps, easy enough to answer the third question of the humble philosopher. The only way to raise the level of Harijans is for the Harijan servants to raise their own level by prayer and penitential fasting and by so training their acoustic faculty as to listen to the inner voice.",

      "fullContent": "WORKERS’ CONFERENCE, MADRAS {1} January 29, 1946 Q.Can a worker who has taken up one item of constructive work dabble in others? Is it right for him to do so? If so, how? A. Constructive programme as it stands today is comprised of 18 items. The spinning-wheel as the symbol of non-violence occupies the central place. So every worker must spin and know all about spinning. Supposing a worker takes paper-making as his main occu- pation and has to find his livelihood also throught it, he won’t have much time left for other things. But he will be able to render some other service to the villagers besides that which he renders through the spinning-wheel and paper-making. For instance, he can work for improving the sanitation of the place and render advice about the care of the sick when he cannot take up full responsibility for nursing them. Supposing another worker decides to concentrate on the spinn- ing wheel only and to find his livelihood also through that, he can do so. I have no doubt in my mind that the wheel can serve as the instrument of earning one’s livelihood and at the same time enable the worker to render useful service to his neighbours. The thing is that every worker should decide for himself what will be his main activity besides the spinning-wheel, and what will be his subsidiary activities. Whatever he does, he should do intelligently and with knowledge. Thus, in order to ply the wheel intelligently, he should know all the processes that precede and succeed spinning. He should have full knowledge of the activities that he wishes to concentrate upon and have a general working knowledge about other items of the construc- tive programme. A student of astronomy cannot know astronomy without some knowledge of science in general. Similarly a worker cannot afford to be utterly ignorant about other items of constructive work. Q.Please explain the meaning of samagra gramseva of your conception. How can we fit ourselves for that? A.The 18-fold constructive programme includes samagra gram- seva. A samagra gramsevak must know everybody living in the village and render them such service as he can. That does not mean that the worker will be able to do everything single-handed. He will show them the way of helping themselves and procure for them such help and mate-rials as they require. He will train up his own helpers. He will so win over the villagers that they will seek and follow his advice. Supposing I go and settle down in a village with a ghani (village oil-press), I won’t be an ordinary ghanchi (oil-presser) earn- ing 15-20 rupees a month. I will be a Mahatma ghanchi. I have used the word Mahatma in fun but what I mean to say is that as ghanchi I will become a model for the villagers to follow. I will be a ghan- chi who knows the Gita and the Koran. I will be learned enough to teach their children. I may not be able to do so for lack of time. The villagers will come to me and ask me: ‘Please make arran-gements for our children’s education.’ I will tell them: ‘I can find you a teacher but you will have to bear the expenses.’ And they will be prepared to do so most willingly. I will teach them spinning and when they come and ask me for the services of a weaver, I will find them a weaver on the same terms as I found them a teacher. And the weaver will teach them how to weave their own cloth. I will inculcate in them the impor- tance of hygiene and sanitation, and when they come and ask me for a sweeper, I will tell them: ‘I will be your sweeper{2} and I will train you all in the job.’ This is my conception of samagra gramseva. You may tell me that I will never find a ghanchi of this description in this age. Then I will say that we cannot help to improve our villages in this age. Take the exam-ple of a ghanchi in Russia. After all the man who runs an oil-mill is a ghanchi. He has money but his strength does not lie in his money. Real strength lies in knowledge. True knowledge gives a moral standing and moral standing and moral strength. Everyone seeks the advice of such a man. Take the instance of Vinoba. He is a good ghanchi. You all know what he does, and you can all follow his example according to your capacity.{3} Q.Khadi work has been carried on for the last 20 years for the purpose of solving the problem of unemployment. Now if priority is to be given for an all-round uplift of the villages, then (1) arrangements should be there for the tiller of the soil so that he gets full remuneration for his labour; (2) efforts should be made to improve agriculture; (3) if there is some spare time, spinning and such other industries should be introduced in the villages. According to my scheme, khadi and gramodyog get a third place. How far am I right in this? A. When khadi was first introduced, we used to say that it was meant for helping the poor. But at the same time I had told the country that swaraj rested upon cotton yarn. Both the things went on simultaneously. But you paid attention only to one of them. This was our ill-luck. I had brought the idea of khadi from South Africa. From there I could visualize that till we chose an occupation in which millions of men and women of India could take part, swaraj could not be achieved even through truth and non-violence. Those who have to work for their livelihood may do so. But they can spin voluntarily for their country or they can work at some occupation for their survival. I hope you understand the difference between the two. When I came to India, then also women were carding. I placed before them the idea of swaraj as I understood it. Whether the poor earned their livelihood through khadi or adopted it as a means of swaraj, both the things could go hand in hand. I realized that real freedom could be attained only in this way. Therefore I placed before the Congress the idea of khadi. The Congress accepted khadi in 1920. You should know that till that day the Congress had no flag. When people realized the importance of khadi, the tricolour flag came into being. In the Aga Khan Palace I used to think constantly about the place of khadi. It is a matter of shame that I was released{4} on grounds of ill-health. The Government did not want that, like Ba and Mahadev, I too should die there.{5} Therefore they released me. After my release I placed before you the same idea. Was khadi only a means of econo- mically helping the poor or was it a means of attaining swaraj also? If we wish to make khadi a means of achieving freedom, then we shall have to change our method of work. Many people were disappointed with spinning only for economic reasons. To spin for the whole day and get just an anna was not enough. We raised the status of women by raising the wages of the women spinners. But at the time we emphasized the point that the spinners should also wear khadi. This was the second step. Now the third step is that all those who wear khadi should spin. How splendid it would be, if all the people of Madras should spin and also weave the yarn spun by them. Otherwise they can get their yarn woven at a nearby place. This is the way of the village to get all things done at minimum cost and labour. The urban way is just the opposite. When I visited Lancashire, I observed that the workers never wore the cloth that they themselves produced. For them the cloth was imported from Ireland. Some embroidered cloth from Madras was also used. Now, if the villagers or the cultivators are able to spin and produce yarn for their own use, we can save them a lot of trouble. And, if they do so with knowledge, they would be bringing swaraj nearer. This is the new policy of khadi. If you have understood my point, then the place of khadi is not third, but it remains first. I have made khadi or the spinning-wheel the symbol of ahimsa. Ahimsa is a unique thing. You can make anything its symbol. I made the charkha its symbol and not the rosary after due thought. If we spin just one length all the time taking the name of God, then the spinning-wheel itself becomes our rosary. Spinning itself becomes sacrificial work. One who having eyes does not see the light of the sun and having a skin does not feel its warmth is dead, though living. The spinning-wheel is the life of constructive work. If you take away that, all the other seventeen items will become a lifeless corpse. If we wish to achieve swaraj for the poorest of the poor and the weakest of the weak, for the crores of women, whose only guardian is God, and not only for some educated women, it can be done only through the spinning-wheel. And, without the spinning-wheel, the constructive programme becomes a mere cipher. It becomes ten if the zero is placed after one. Zero alone has no value. Q.Ninety-five per cent of agriculture in India depends on rains. For the improvement of farming more than 50 per cent of it should be done through irrigation. It is the experience of the experts that in this way alone farming can be improved. Under all circumstances this sort of improvement will have a prominent place in the economic planning of India. In case such an improvement in farming is introduced, it becomes a complete industry which goes on throughout the year. In that case the spinning-wheel do not occupy the place of a supplementary industry. If we want to ply it in the villages, we will have to think of a place for it as for the hand- loom. Please throw light on this matter. A. Khadi and all the activities connected with it have a direct relation with satyagraha. Whatever credit I have earned, I have earned it through satyagraha. I am not a learned man. I consider myself and feel somewhat stupid before scholars in Tamil, English, Hindustani and even Gujarati. But I have placed before you satyagraha know- ingly and after careful thinking. I have not acquired it from books, but from experience. I could see that khadi industry could serve as a means of achieving . Farming cannot take that place. Millions of men, women and children cannot take part in it . I live for the freedom of the country and work continu- ously for it. After I am worn out, I do not wish to live; not even for enjoyment. For that matter I am always happy and never sad. If I were born in free India, perhaps I would not have insisted on khadi. But, even when I was in South Africa, I knew that India was a slave country and to remove that slavery I thought of the spinning-wheel as the means. First of all do not possess full knowledge about agriculture. But the simple thing is that we cannot progress much without the help of the Government. Canals will have to be constructed, some trees will have to be cut down. We will have to use the new engineering devices. At every step, the Government’s help will be required. Q.An Indian villager spends about 80 per cent on foodgrains and 12 per cent on cloth. Does it not follow that agriculture holds the most important place in our village uplift scheme? Would it not be proper to give to agriculture instead of to khadi the place of the sun in the solar system ? A. Even if all that is correct, farming cannot take the place of the spinning-wheel. It is a great thing to become industrious through the spinning-wheel and give up lethargy. The key to our swaraj lies in it. When we keep the spinning-wheel in the centre and try to remove its defects, we learn many things by the way. You must know that I talk about the charkha as regards India. I would not ply charkha in the North Pole. If India understands the value of the sspinning-wheel, swaraj can be certainly attained through it. To some extent there is propaganda of the spinning-wheel in the cities. It is welcome. But the villagers have to adopt the spinning-wheel. In order to link it with agriculture, the villgers had better adopt it.{6} Q.Is it possible to achieve nationalization of land in a non-violent manner? “Yes” came the answer from Gandhiji. He made it perfectly clear that kisans, the tillers of the land, should educate kisans on their rights and duties, and tell them how they should develop self-confidence and courage to assert their just rights. Satyagraha might have to be resorted to in the process of claiming ownership of the land, and the zamindars were not rakshasas to oppress them, for it would not be to their benefit to do so. Q.What should be done when an unsympathetic Indian State placed obstacles in the way of the constructive programme? Gandhiji said that the result depended entirely on the workers themselves and the extent to which they were prepared to suffer for the cause. Gandhiji, replying to another question, approved of Kaka Kalelkar’s suggestion to bring in words belonging to other languages to make themselves intelligible in their addresses to gatherings. If any pandit objected to this procedure, he would be only ignoring realities. He, however, pointed out the absurdity of using bombastic words like chathushpada peetham for chair and lakhini nilaya for an ink-stand. Gandhiji was asked as to what extent students could engage themselves in political work. Mahatmaji said that there was quite enough work for students to do alongside of their studies. They could, for instance, do a great deal in connection with removal of illiteracy. But he was not in favour of students associating themselves with party politics or controversies as they could not do justice to such work, remaining as students. If some of them felt like leaving schools and colleges with a view to engaging themselves in national work, they were free to do so.{7} To a question whether constructive workers can go to jails, Mahatma Gandhi said : As far as possible, constructive workers should wholly devote their time to the 18-point programme. This should be the case at almost all times. But when the situation in the country is extraordi- nary and the constructive worker feels impelled to go to jail, then, of course, he can go to jail. This is, however, only in extraordinary circumstances.{8} Harijan, 17-3-1946, and Khadi Jagat, April 1946; also The Hindu, 30-1-1946,",

      "fullContent": "Dr. H. W. B. Moreno writes :{1} I can noly say that every community would be on a par with every other under the swaraj Constitution. I invite the attention of all the minorities concerned to the Fundamental Rights Resolution{2} of the Congress. So far as the Working Committee could, it took care to see that the rights of minorities were fully secured under that Resolution. That Resolution is now before the Congress Committee with a view to strengthening it. All those who have useful suggestions should send them to the Committee for consideration. But I know that this is not what Dr. Moreno wants. He wants to know where the Anglo-Indians will come in specifically. My answer is they would come in where their merit would take them. There would most decidedly be nothing to prevent them from occupying the highest position that any other Indian may be capable of occupying. The fact however is that the AngloIndians as a class have occupied or attempted to occupy the position of rulers. They have not as a class taken part in the national movement. They have isolated themselves in their favoured position. Under swaraj there will be no favoured posi- tion for anybody. Hence like the Englishmen whose cry for equality means retention of favoured position the Anglo-Indians may feel aggrieved that they would be at a disadvantage under swaraj if they did not have the present favoured position guaranteed. I hope however that Dr. Moreno has no such favouritism in view. If I know him correctly, I expect he seeks information about the sub-merged Anglo-Indians. Of them I can say with confidence that I should be surprised if they did not in common with the submerged of the other communities find themselves in a better position than they are in today. Anyway, there are enough Congressmen who are pledged to the abolition of all unjust privileges, all unnatural inequ- alities. If the condition of the masses is found to undergo rapid improvement under swaraj, the Anglo-Indian poor must share it to the fullest extent possible. The Congress aims at swaraj for the whole nation and not a section. And it will fight on till that end is achieved. I therefore invite all the minorities to join the national movement and to hasten the advent of the happy day. Let it not also be said of any of them that in the hour of the nation’s trial, they stood aside and came in to enjoy their share of the happiness. They will get the share but they will not relish it even as a man who has not toiled for his meal cannot enjoy it though it is placed before him.",

      "fullContent": "A student writes:{1} Everyone is impelled sometimes to ask this question. Nevertheless it is based on a misunderstanding. A vow has the effect of raising us exactly because, in spite of it, there is a chance of our falling. If there was no such danger, there would be no scope for striving. A vow serves the same purpose as a lighthouse does. If we keep our eyes fixed on it, we shall come safe through any storm. The lighthouse itself cannot quieten the storm, yet it guides sailors caught in a storm and helps them to fight it, even so a vow is a kind of powerful force which saves a human being from the innumer- able waves raging in the heart. This being the case, no way has been found, or is likely to be found, by following which a person taking a vow can be assured that he will never fall. And this is as it should be; otherwise the moral injunctions about truth and so on will lose the great value which is attached to them. One has to exert oneself so much to acquire ordinary knowledge or raise a few lakhs of rupees for a fund. There are many who do not mind risking their lives merely to be able to see a lifeless spot like the North Pole. Why should we, then, wonder or be unhappy if we have to put in a thousand times more difficult effort in order to conquer our powerful foes such as anger, malice and so on. Our success lies in the very struggle for this deathless glory. The effort itself is victory. If those who sail to the North Pole fail in their object, their effort may be considered to have been wasted, but every effort we make in our life to conquer these foes) attachment and aversion will have taken us forward. Thus, no effort, however slight, towards such an end is ever wasted that is the Lord’s assurance.{2} The only encouragement, therefore, which I can give this student is that he should go on striving and never lose heart. He should never abandon the vow. He should banish from his dictionary the word “impossible”. If he forgets his vow at any time, he should do prayaschitta{3} and remind himself of the vow. Every time he violates it, he should start again, and have complete confidence that he is bound at last to succeed. No man of spiritual illumination has ever told us of his experience that untruth had ever triumphed; on the contrary every such person has unanimously proclaimed most emphatically his experience that in the end truth triumphs. We should keep the experience of these persons in mind, and entertain no doubts of any kind when striving for a good end or be afraid to take a vow with a virtuous aim. Pandit Rambhuj Datt Chaudhari has left us a poem in Punjabi with the following refrain: “Never accept defeat, though you lose your life.” Navajivan, 1-8-1926",

      "fullContent": "{1} {2} GANDHIJI: Let us realize our amazing limitations. Do not mind even if we have to be like the three tailors of Tooley Street. Our resources are few and limited. We cannot afford to squander money on high sounding schemes and we cannot adopt any and every means. We may fail to get workers and agents, and our branches may have to be few and far between. But I am in no hurry to see a network of institutions all over the country. Ours is a policy of ploughing a lonely furrow . . . . If we find that it is not possible for any industry to pay this minimum living wage, we had better close our shop. We should see that in any industry that we handle the wage covers a reasonable maintenance allowance. DR. PRAFULLA: When I was an official earning a salary, I used to calculate how much my servants, including their dependants, would need for a fair maintenance and I used to pay them accordingly. It used to come to Rs. 20 a month. With clothing and other needs, it would come to Rs. 30. GANDHIJI (laughingly): Then if you like we shall have a rupee a day as the minimum wage for Bengal. What you used to do as an official you have now to do as a member of the Association. I would certainly have the wage as high as possible and include in it the maintenance of at least one dependant. But you will go as far as you can. Sjt. Vaikuntha Mehta, who is the Managing Director of the Provincial Co- operative Bank in Bombay, had not the slightest doubt that the sooner we tackled the question the better; for, when we insisted on an adequate solution of the wage question and that of work in organized large-scale industries, it was our duty to attend to these question in case of unorganized industries. There were obvious difficulties, but he had no doubt that the moment people were made to see that ninety per cent or more of the rupee that the people spend on an article they purchase goes directly into the pocket of the man who has produced it, they would not grudge to pay the money. Sjt. Shankerlal Banker emphasized the importance of collecting data, from different provinces, of the prices of the minimum articles of a balanced diet, but he had some difficulty in applying the wage question to existing industries. Gandhiji made it clear that we were exclusively concerned with dead or dying industries which we were trying to revive and we were not going to disturb the existing industries. Was the minimum wage likely to make matters difficult for the villager? What about the little articles of the villagers’ daily need, earthen pots and lamps, for instance? Because the townspeople were to pay a higher price for those articles, were the villagers also to pay that higher price? Already villagers in villages in close proximity to towns were paying a higher price for milk than those in distant villages. Gandhiji said: That was inevitable. But the villagers among themselves will adjust the prices. Besides, when our organization is in good running order, the carpenter and the smith and the weaver and the spinner, who purchase from the potter at the minimum wage price, will have also had their minimum-wage price for their respective wares, and they won’t grudge the poor potter his price. But that is a distant goal. Let us at the present moment content ourselves with things that pass out of villages to the towns and let us refuse to have them at anything less than the minimum-living-wage price.{3}",

      "fullContent": "{1} BARDOLI, January 8, 1942{2} The first was the question about the wells: Should we seek the co-operation of Harijans, and, if so, to what extent? Co-operation is necessary, but we must not take the Harijans in a body and invade the savarna quarters. We should visit the wells, ascertain the classes of people using them, and reason with these to let the Harijans use them. Regarding Local Board wells the help of offi- cials may be freely sought, and such Harijans may be asked to go and use the wells as may be prepared to stand ill-treatment. But the brunt should be borne by the sevaks{3}, care being taken to stand between the Harijans and those who would threaten to molest or belabour them. The Harijans should be invariably asked to use clean vessels and observe all the ordinary rules of cleanliness. We can also dig wells for Harijans and invite the savarnas to use them. It is likely that the Harijans may be boycotted, we should see that they get employment elsewhere. The Harijans have to be taught to learn to assert themselves firmly and non-violently, and the savarnas may be gently reminded that injustice cannot last for ever. These are broad principles, but everyone has to take measures suited to the circumstances in each case. Q.Can’t we insist on the admission of Harijan boys to hostels where all non-Harijan Hindu boys are admitted? A. Of course, but care should be taken to see that the hostel is not exclusively for a particular community or section of Hindus. Where all sections are admitted and only the Harijans are excluded, the workers should strain every nerve to get the Harijans admitted. When I said that removal of untouchability did not include the removal of restrictions on inter-dining and intermarriage, I had the general Hindu public in mind, not the Congress workers or Congress- men. These have to abolish untouchability from every part of their life. The next question was about the temptations given by missionaries in the shape of books, school fees, etc., with a view to the boys’ ultimate conversion. How was one to deal with them? The missionaries have of course the right to preach the gospel of Christ and to invite non-Christians to embrace Christianity. But every attempt to press material benefits or attractions in the aid of conversion should be freely exposed, and the Harijans should be edu- cated to resist these temptations. Q.What are the qualifications that a Harijan sevak should have in order to make his work felt? A. Such a question is rather late in the day. But I shall try to answer it again. It is a misfortune that politics have been mixed up with anti-untouchability work, which is essentially one of self- purification, justice, humanity. Long before I took to politics I felt that abolition of untouchability and Hindu-Muslim unity were essential for national well-being. In order to prevent the vivisection of Hinduism I had to fight it with my life, and the question did receive a political complexion, but in essence it is a purely religious and moral question. Every sevak must be fired with a passion to purify Hinduism, and must be ready to lay down his life in the attempt. Such a sevak will be ready to sacrifice his all—family connections, social advantages, and life itself—in order to wipe out the blot on Hinduism. The work should be as one of life’s essential functions, e.g., offering one’s prayers, ablutions, etc., not carrying emolument or reward. If the worker is fired with this passion, the way will be clear before him. Thus a worker would rather starve than allow the Harijans to be starved, would hesitate to use amenities which are denied to the Harijans and feel increasing identification with them every day. All this work is to be done without regard to the political results. Assum- ing for a moment that swaraj does not come as a result of the abolition of untouchability, the work has to be done in order to keep Hinduism pure and alive. I know that with some of the Congressmen the work has only a political meaning, but it is wrong. If they seek justice from an alien Government, they must first do justice to their own kith and kin. That is the fundamental maxim of equity—he who seeks equity must do equity. There is, I know, a section who says that political freedom must be won first and social reform would follow later. It is a wrong idea, and certainly inconsistent with one who would win swaraj by non- violent means. But the Harijan worker has to educate both the ortho- dox and exclusively political-minded people. Let him not judge others, but by selfless self-effacing service set an example to them.",

      "fullContent": "{1} C HAUMUHANI, November 8, 1946 One of the friends suggested that in order to restore confidence Hindu leaders should reinforce the appeals of the Muslims to the refugees to go back to their villages. Gandhiji replied that that was not the right way to dispel the apprehension and distrust of the Hindus which was well grounded. He would not be able to advise them to return to their homes unless there was at least one good Hindu and one good Mussalman for each village who would stand guarantee for their safety and security and who would be prepared to immolate himself before a hair of their head was touched. It was for the Muslim League leaders who were also members of the Government to say whether such men would be forthcoming. There was no other way to restore confidence after all that had happened. They all agreed with Gandhiji’s suggestion and said that they would do their best to give effect to it.",

Without our sympathy and passive support, the goondas would have no legs to stand upon. I want to touch the hearts of those who are behind the goondas. But must you launch your fast at this stage? why not wait and watch a little? It would be too late afterwards. The minority Muslims cannot be left in a perilous state. My fast has to be preventive if it is to be any good. I know I shall be able to tackle the Punjab too if I can control Calcutta. But if I falter now, the conflagration may spread and soon, I can see clearly, two or three powers will be upon us and thus will end our short-lived dream of independence. But supposing you die, the conflagration would be worse. At least I won’t be there to witness it. I shall have done my bit. More is not given a man to do. But why add sour lemon juice to water, if you are to put yourself entirely in God’s hands? You are right. I allowed it out of weakness. It jarred on me even as I wrote it.

      "fullContent": "AND ARUNA ASAF ALI NEW DELHI, July 8, 1947 God has chastised me severely. I have not known a test more severe than this. What a high standard of morality we had when we were slaves. We are about to suffer the greatest fall from that lofty height in the so-called “priceless freedom” which is approaching. What more is left to be witnessed now? How can I give you any idea of what is going on in my mind? At one time I feel that Bihar is calling me, at another time I hear the call from Noakhali where I succeed to some extent in establishing peace. When I came here from Patna a month ago, I imagined that I would be back at my work in a week. But in the course of this one month so many changes have taken place in the country that a family wouldn’t have seen as many in a generation. I am rotting in Delhi. However, I have not at all given up Noakhali and Bihar work. I am very keen to go to the Punjab also. But I cannot decide where to go. Being in this state of mind, I am following a great thinker who said, “If you cannot see your way, it is better to stay where you are.” So I am here. I cannot go to sevagram at present. I must either accomplish something or die in the attempt. I will think of something new only when I have reached one of these two places. There is no third way. At the moment I do not feel like giving any advice to the Ashram inmates. In all these years I have said much to them, made them do much work. Now every one of them should do what they think best. Ultimately all service is alike in value. The head is perched high in the body and it has great value but the soles, though at the very bottom and in contact with dirt, are not any lower in value. If the sole is pricked by a thorn and one is unable to walk, how much one feels it! Similarly those who have dedicated themselves to service may render it in any manner they like according to their ability and interest. To me every kind of service is valuable.",

      "fullContent": "{1} Gandhiji said: I ought to acknowledge that I have read this article of yours. I too did not approve of it. There is a reason for this. You are free to criticize, but you have made fun of the conference as a whole. Your criticism is not in the right spirit. The purport of it appears to be that you do not desire unity at all and that you disapprove of the very fact that the conference was held. Why should we not be critical? We must admit, at any rate, that those who had assembled meant to do some good work and made an honest effort to do so. You, however, have adopted an attitude of fun and ridicule alone. And what a newspaper you chose for this! Muballig, a paper which has long been and is still full of hatred. Could you not have chosen any other newspaper? You could have written to Young India. You could have admitted the bona fides of the conference. However, because your article appears in a newspaper which is given to venomous and acrimonious writing, some persons may perhaps get the impression that Khwaja Sahib is opposed to the very idea of unity. . . . Are you not talking of Abdul Kadar Jilani?{2} In jail too I had read of him. Once, when he, as a child, set out on a journey, his mother had given him some gold coins. As he was but a child she sewed them up in his coat and, together with these coins, gave him the instruction not to tell a lie under any circumstances, even if heaven and earth crashed but always to tell the truth. The party was waylaid by robbers, who searched everyone and took that they had. It was Abdul Kadar’s turn. He was asked what he had on him. He pointed to the gold coins sewed inside the coat. The robbers were astonished and set him free. More than that, his truthfulness resulted in their returning the loot taken from the others as well. Even though Islam abounds in such instances, it is not proper that you cite them before Hindus. Are there such instances only in Islam? They can be found at every step in Hinduism also. However, just as one need not give up one’s own religion and take to Hinduism because of these instances, similarly, one need not embrace Islam because of instances like those of Abdul Kadar. I do not mind if there are many such instances among Muslims and, because of them, the whole of India gets converted to Islam. However, just as there have been the best as well as the worst of men among Hindus, so too there are wicked persons among the Muslims also. I would not like you to cite the example of Abdul Kadar to convert anyone to Islam. You can talk to Hindus on other matters. Why do you ask the Dheds and the Bhangis to become Muslims? You could tell the Hindus,” There have been very tolerant men amongst you; you treat all creatures alike; how can you regard human beings as untouchables? Are you not ashamed of keeping humans apart?” You can serve Hinduism in this manner. By quoting the example of Abdul Kadar, I could tell Muslims,” Your religion is practised by such lovers of truth who advocate tolerance and who would forgive even their enemies. How can you bring disgrace upon them?” Thus would I serve Islam. We would then be purifying our own religion to such an extent that no one would be able to prevent those who wish to embrace it. It would, however, be an outrage to take advantage of someone’s poverty and tell him,” Come my friend, I shall give you so many rupees, pay off your debts; because your co-religionists are pestering you, you come over to us.” He does this not because of his love for Islam, but because of the sum that is offered to him. What food did the people get who came to Mohammed Sahib? Dates and water, and when even that was not available, a fast. Nevertheless, out of respect for his personality and drawn by his spiritual power, people used to flock to him and embrace Islam. Speaking for myself, if a new Mohammed Sahib comes forward and, drawn by his personal magnetism, the whole world gets converted to Islam, I would not mind this in the least. I say all this only because I know the appeal of Islam. I do not believe that Islam was spread through the sword; it has been spread by fakirs. It has spread through truth, austerity and courage. Everyone will admit that Islam has been defended by the sword; but for its spread only the fakirs can claim credit. I, therefore, assert that spreading Islam through force or favours or in any such way is not rendering service to it but rather bringing disgrace upon it. I say this only because of my love for Islam.",

      "fullContent": "WILKINSON{1} {2} Ceresole proceeded to tell Gandhiji of some of the books he had recently read. There was India in the Dark Wood . . . wanting “the main framework of the dominant Hindu philosophy to be shattered”. . . . Pierre Ceresole said he had turned from this book with relief to Frank Lonwood’s book Jesus Lord or Leader where the author rejects the claim of Christianity as the final religion and pines for “a fuller and richer faith than we have yet reached and to believe that God, who has nowhere left Himself without witness,will use the highest institutions of other systems and of many races to enrich the thinking and worship of mankind.” He sees definite gain in the abandonment of a special claim for the inspiration of the Bible, and classes himself among those “who humbly desire to follow Jesus as leader, though their view of truth will not allow them to worship him as Lord”. Gandhiji said: There is a swing in the pendulum, and I have a Christian friend telling me that the Gita shows him how to live the New Testament, and that many passages in the latter which used to be dark were intelligible to him through a study of the Gita. And yet Ceresole feels that each one must find his solace from his own faith. He attended our prayer meetings regularly, morning and evening, but said one evening: “This repetition of one and the same thing over and over again jars on me. It may be the defect of my rationalist, mathematical temperament. But somehow I cannot like the repetition.”. . . GANDHIJI: But even in mathematics you have your recurring decimals. PIERRE CERESOLE: But each recurs with a definite new fact. G. Even so each repetition, or japa as it is called, has a new meaning, each repetition carries you nearer and nearer to God. This is a concrete fact, and I may tell you that you are here talking to no theorist but to one who has experienced what he says every minute of his life, so much so that it is easier for the life to stop than for this incessant process to stop. It is a definite need of the soul. P.C. I quite see it, but for the average man it becomes an empty formula. G. I agree, but the best thing is liable to be abused. There is room for any amount of hypocrisy, but even hypocrisy is an ode to virtue. And I know that for ten thousand hypocrites you would find millions of simple souls who find their solace from it. It is like scaffolding quite essential to a building. P.C. But if I may carry the simile a little further, you agree that the scaffolding has to be removed when the building is complete? G. Yes, it would be removed when this body is removed. P. C. Why? JOE WILKINSON: Because we are eternally building. G. Because we are eternally striving after perfection. God alone is perfect, man is never perfect.",

      "fullContent": "{1} {2} So that is Frydman. You have come to study the spinning-wheel. But you will not win the Rs. 100,000 prize, as the prize has been withdrawn. joined heartily in the laughter and said, “Oh, no, I do not want the prize, my only aim is to give you the wheel you want.” He again asked a number of questions about the wheel, discussed various improvements and left for Wardha.{3} He inquired if Gandhiji’s aim was just humanitarian in sitting down in the village, just serving the villagers as best he could ! I am here to serve no one else but myself, to find my own self- realization through the service of these village folk. Man’s ultimate aim is the realization of God, and all his activities, social, political, religious, have to be guided by the ultimate aim of the vision of God. The immediate service of all human beings becomes a necessary part of the endeavour simply because the only way to find God is to see Him in His creation and be one with it. This can only be done by service of all. And this cannot be done except through one’s country. I am part and parcel of the whole, and I cannot find Him apart from the rest of humanity. My countrymen are my nearest neighbours. They have become so helpless, so resourceless, so inert that I must concentrate on serving them. If I could persuade myself that I should find Him in a Himalayan cave, I would proceed there immediately. But I know that I cannot find Him apart from humanity. But some comforts may be necessary even for man’s spiritual advancement. One could not advance himself by identifying himself with the discomfort and squalour of the villager? A certain degree of physical harmony and comfort is necessary, but above a certain level it becomes a hindrance instead of help. Therefore the ideal of creating an unlimited number of wants and satisfying them seems to be a delusion and a snare. The satisfaction of one’s physical needs, even the intellectual needs of one’s narrow self, must meet at a certain point a dead stop, before it degenerates into physical and intellectual voluptuousness. A man must arrange his physical and cultural circumstances so that they do not hinder him in his service of humanity, on which all his energies should be concentrated. What then was the secret of his concentration on the village? I have been saying that if untouchability stays, Hinduism goes; even so I would say that if the village perishes, India will perish too. It will be no more India, Her own mission in the world will get lost. The revival of the village is possible only when it is no more exploited. Industrialization on a mass scale will necessarily lead to passive or active exploitation of the villagers as the problems of competition and marketing come in. Therefore we have to concentrate on the village being self-contained, manufacturing mainly for use. Provided this character of the village industry is maintained, there would be no objection to villagers using even the modern machines and tools that they can make and can afford to use. Only they should not be used as a means of exploitation of others.",

      "fullContent": "BHARAT SABHA{1} {2} A few representatives of the Red Shirts waited in deputation on Gandhiji and he had a long heart-to-heart talk with them. They explained that it was never their intention to do any physical harm to him, that his life and his health were as dear to them as to anyone else, and that individual terrorism was not their creed. They were adamant in their quarrel with the truce which, they believed, can never lead them to their goal of Workers’ and Peasants’ Free Republic in India. Gandhiji said : But my dear young men, go and see Bihar and you will find a workers’ and peasants’ republic working there. Where there was fear and slavery ten years ago, there is courage and bravery and resistance to wrong. If you want capital to be extinct or you want to abolish moneyed men or the capitalists, you will never succeed. What you must do is to demonstrate to the capitalists the power of labour and they will consent to be the trustees of those who toil for them. I do not want anything more for workers and peasants than enough to eat and house and clothe themselves and live in ordinary comfort as self- respecting human beings. After that condition of things is brought about the brainiest among them will certainly manage to acquire more wealth than the rest. But I have told you what I want. I want the rich to hold their riches in trust for the poor or to give them up for them. Do you know that I gave up all my property when I founded Tolstoy Farm? Ruskin’sUnto This Last inspired me and I built my farm on those lines. You will now recognize that I am, so to say, a “foundation member” of your peasants’ and workers’ republic. And what do you prize more, wealth or work? Supposing you were to be stranded in the desert of Sahara with cart-loads of money, how would it help you? But if you can work you may not have to go hungry. How then is wealth to be preferred to work? Go and see for yourselves the Labour Union of Ahmedabad at work and see how they are trying to establish a republic of their own. Q. Punjab is goonda-raj, Mahatmaji. Where do find the change of heart? A. But I never said that there had been a change of heart on the part of the Government. Q.Why then did you give such a certificate to Lord Irwin? A. Just as I have given a certificate to you, young men! I have admired your self-restraint, though I disapprove of your action against me. In the same way I was struck with Lord Irwin’s frankness, sincerity and friendliness and I paid a tribute to it. That was nothing unusual for me. There was no question of a change of heart. The settlement I had never regarded as an indication of change of heart, and so the executions did not alter the position. But I should certainly have given Government credit for some change of heart if they had commuted the sentences.",

      "fullContent": "MEETING—II {1} June 24, 1946 Their recommendation will remain in their mouths or on the printed paper. We shall have no authority even to order a constable if there is a row in the Constituent Assembly. This is a dangerous situation. There must be the imprimatur of the Parliament and real power in the Central Government before we can make anything of the Constituent Assembly. The imprimatur of the Parliament would clear the way for the Chairman of the Constituent Assembly (by making the issue adjudicable) in case he wants to refer a point of major importance to the Federal Court for decision. In the course of the discussion that followed, the Sardar pressed with great vigour his view that the explanation given by the Cabinet Mission in regard to the form issued by the Reforms Office was quite adequate and the Congress could not postpone giving its decision forthwith without damaging its prestige. Bapu scribbled. My mind is in a fog. . . . It centres round the insertion of reference to para 19 . . . and the meaning of “scrapping the whole plan” (of the Interim Government).{2} I have asked Rajen Babu and Sarat Babu as lawyers whether the candidates, after acting according to the instructions given to Governors, can afterwards disregard them.{3} If the answer is yes then my mouth will be shut although I find a great danger in joining . You examine all the instructions. There are other things in it which irk me. Now I think the point will also be raised that the State Paper should bear the imprimatur of the Parliament.{4} Whatever the Cabinet Mission may say or write it will remain in their mouths or on the printed paper. They have opened here a Reform Office. Whatever they do and the interpretation they put will be final. The Government office not being in your hands you cannot have control over it. You should consider all this. You should do nothing in haste. I shall be meeting them today or tomorrow after which I shall be able to enlighten you as I shall be better informed. Today’s interview has not produced a good impression on my mind. Because of my silence I could not myself ask questions. So I do not blame these people. I am in a very delicate position.

Without doing this work we cannot reach the road to swaraj. And even supposing we did, that swaraj would not be true swaraj, but the reign of blind superstition and irreligion. Today many Hindus believe that Hinduism would perish with the eradication of untouchability. But I see the end of Hinduism unless untouchability is wiped out. In this age people do not fight with swords for the sake of religion. Religious awakening is not and should not be brought about nor religion protected at the point of the sword. But religions will be compared and judged by our reasons and hearts. Untouchability is opposed to reason and sentiment. It is a great crime. As Congressmen we must accept this. If in consequence only a handful of Hindus remain in the Congress, let it be so. The Congress will then be come a powerful organization. Today there is only a risk of civil strife. If, however, untouchability is not wiped out, civil strife is a certainty. Unless we take bold measures against untouchability, civil strife is bound to follow.",

      "fullContent": "{1} {2} GANDHIJI : Do you therefore say that other religions are untrue?{3} KRZENSKI: If others are convinced that their religions are true they are saved. G. Therefore you will say that everyone would be saved even through untruth. For you say that if a man really and sincerely believes in what is as a matter of fact untruth, he is saved. Would you not also hold, therefore, that your own way may be untrue but that you are convinced that it is true and therefore you will be saved? K. But I have studied all religions and have found that mine is the only true religion. G. But so have others studied other religions. What about them? Well, I go further and tell you that religion is one and it has several branches which are all equal. K. I accept that no religion lacks divine inspiration but all have not the same truth, because all have not the same light. G. It is an essentially untrue position to take, for a seeker after truth, that he alone is in absolute possession of truth. What is happening to the poor astronomers today? They are changing their position every day, and there are scientists who impeach even Einstein’s latest theory. K. No. But I have examined the arguments in favour of other religions. G. But it is an intellectual examination. You require different scales to weigh spiritual truths. Either we are all untrue—quite a logical position to take—but since truth does not come out of untruth it is better to say that we all have truth but not the complete truth. For God reveals His truth to instruments that are imperfect. Raindrops of purest distilled water become diluted or polluted as soon as they come in contact with mother earth. My submission is that your position is arrogant. But I suggest to you a better position. Accept all religions as equal, for all have the same root and the same laws of growth. K. It is necessary to examine every religion philosophically and find out which is more harmonious, more perfect. G. That presupposes that all religions are in watertight compartments. That is wrong. They are always growing. Let us not limit God’s function. He may reveal Himself in a thousand ways and a thousand times. Now the professor switched on to the next question, viz., that of fighting materialism. G. It is no use trying to fight these forces without giving up the idea of conversion, which I assure you is the deadliest poison that ever sapped the fountain of truth. K. But I have a great respect for your religion. G. Not enough. I had that feeling myself one day, but I found that it was not enough. Unless I accept the position that all religions are equal, and I have as much regard for other religions as I have for my own, I would not be able to live in the boiling war around me. Any make-believe combination of spiritual forces is doomed to failure if this fundamental position is not accepted. I read and get all my inspiration from the Gita. But I also read the Bible and the Koran to enrich my own religion. I incorporate all that is good in other religions. K. That is your goodwill. G. That is not enough. K. But I have great respect for you. G. Not enough. If I were to join the Catholic Church you would have greater respect for me. K. Oh yes, if you became a Catholic you would be as great as St. Francis. G. But not otherwise? A Hindu cannot be a St. Francis? Poor Hindu! K. But may I take your photograph? G. No, surely you don’t care for materialism! And it is all materialism, isn’t it?",

      "fullContent": "PRODUCTION{1} QUESTION: In Bihar something like five thousand women walk ten miles a day to receive the present scanty wage. More would come if we could sell more khadi. What would happen to these poor women, if the demand for khadi disappeared?” GANDHIJI: Quite, right. I know the same is the state of things in Bengal villages and in South India. But I would put your proposition in a converse way. Supposing you gave one pie instead of two pies an hour that you give at present, you would be employing not 5,000 women but 10,000 women. And supposing these helpless women were ready to accept even that miserable pittance, would you dare to do it? I say, you would not. That means that you will have to determine a point beyond which you cannot go. Call it if you will a ‘helpless minimum’. But if that minimum has to be fixed, why not fix it once and for all, no matter whether it affects some of the producers for the time being adversely? So long as the number of purchasers is limited and the number of producers unlimited, there is no doubt that you will have to turn some of the producers away. Why not then have a deliberately fixed, high enough minimum wage to ensure these poor women at least a living wage? Otherwise there would be no end to this unconscious exploitation. A paper manufacturer sends us paper from a place. He is paying the labourers at the rate of six pice per day, and says he hopes to make the paper cheaper. I tell him I will not have it cheaper. Then you will now change the definition of khadi. It no longer remains hand- spun hand-woven cloth, but cloth hand-spun and hand-woven at a particular wage. There is no doubt. I am sorry that you are making the discovery so late. But spinning is a supplementary occupation, we have been telling the world all these years. It is done only in one’s spare hours. Yes and no. I know that there are thousands who are doing it for the whole day. To them it is not a supplementary but a substantive occupation. And even if it is not, why not give them for an hour’s work what you would usually give for any other hour’s work? Do you know that in some parts of Guntur District, people are taking to rice- pounding because it fetches a higher wage than spinning? I do. But you support my argument. They will certainly choose whatever work fetches them a higher wage. Then why not dignify the spinner by a wage which will be equal to any other wage? Practical difficulties are very great. You cannot induce these spinners to conform to your terms. You want a regular register of them, you want them to spin yarn of a particular count, of particular evenness and of particular strength. How will all that be done? The difficulties have got to be conquered. Don’t I know that for considerable length of time there will be tales of long-drawn-out agony—some saying we cannot induce the spinners to spin for themselves, some saying we cannot get them to conform to our requirements? But supposing they conform to our regulations and we give them better machines and better spindles, they will automatically do more work and more than double the wage. That they will do automatically but for no virtue of yours. That more production means more earning is obvious enough. But what are we going to do, by way of justice which we have denied them? No, we shall have to forget that khadi has to compete with mill- cloth. Mill-cloth is mill-cloth and khadi is khadi. The mill-cloth producer will always concentrate on cheapening it, we must concentrate on justice and a fair wage. There can be therefore no comparison between the two. As regards the practical difficulties, let us reduce our establishments, let us stop advertisements, let us not patronize the private producer. It is going to be the test of those who are pledged to khadi. Let them produce it themselves or pay for it enough to give our brothers and sisters a living wage. It is a question of the self-purification of all khadi-weavers. Let us not forget that our mission is the service of Daridranarayana. Difficulties there may be, but let us solve them gradually.{2} Harijan, 10-8-1935",

      "fullContent": "{1} April 3, 1925 GANDHIJI: Does this imply that Lalan can ply the spinning-wheel only if he makes no such claim ? I have not understood in what way it involves the renunciation of the dharma of ahimsa. It is understandable that unlike a house- holder, a sadhu should do nothing which would promote his self- interest; but surely he may ply the spinning-wheel for the welfare of others. Let us take one instance. A sadhu may not go out at night. Supposing, however a neighbour’s house is on fire, if a sadhu stays at home and does not help his neighbour with water, it would, I think, amount to violence rather than non-violence. Similarly, if during a famine, those who are stricken by it are given food only after they do some set work, it becomes their dharma to do what is assigned to them. If people are dying of thirst, but no one is ready to dig with spade and hoe, a sadhu has no choice but to set an example by taking up these tools. It is not enough to ask others to dig. Even when you do not wish to drink a drop of water, nevertheless, if you get ready with a spade and a hoe and are content only after you have quenched the thirst of others, than can be called ahimsa. There is not harm if you drink water even if you do not wish to do so after having quenched the thirst of others. In this way, a sadhu may do many things for the welfare of others; it becomes his duty to do so. Similarly, when there is widespread starvation in India today, when the spinning-wheel enables the poor to be fed, when it has become one’s dharma to make every idle person take to spinning, how can a sadhu be permitted not to spin and advise others of do so? Why should people do something that sadhus do not regard as worthwhile? It becomes the dharma of the sadhu, therefore, to sit down with a spinning-wheel and silently work at it. He should not answer if anyone comes to him and seeks his advice; even if he is asked a second time, he should keep silent; finally, he should break his silence and say that besides doing this he has no other advice to give. Hence this alone is the dharma of the sadhu who is attentive and vigilant. There is a risk of the sadhu turning selfish in this work; in that case, his downfall is but proper. Instead of remaining idle and being a burden to society, he will become industrious and work for his livelihood. I accept the state of extreme non-violence . What, however, is the nature of that state? As a matter of fact, today, sadhus eat and drink like househodlers, they wear and same kind of clothes, they live in the apasaras that have been built for them by the people; they must therefore take part in public life. They must participate in that work which is the greatest public service today. MUNISHRI : It would then be an apaddharma{2}. GANDHIJI: No, it is not that, but the dharma of the age. Today, the dharma of our times is to spin and so long as the sadhu is dependent on society for his daily needs, he must spread the dharma of the age by practising it. Today, you eat the rice grown and cooked by the people, and wear the clothes produced by them. It is a different matter, however, if he eats left-overs lying around, does not care to cover himself, and lives in some unapproachable and unseen cave away from society. He is then free not to observe the dharma of the age. Otherwise, I would say the very same thing today even to the sannyasi who lives and moves in society. In Travancore, I have told the sannyasi who is the guru of the Thiyas{3} not to accept anyone as a disciple unless he comes to him dressed in khadi, so that it would also put an end to overcrowding there. I would ask this of you also. It is possible that this would encourage hypocrisy; but then were there no hypocrites surrounding Shri Rajchandra? It is not we who are harmed by such hypocrisy but the hypocrites themselves. MUNISHRI: I have not gone into this matter in such detail. I shall discuss it with you after doing so.",

      "fullContent": "SANTINIKETAN{1} December 19, 1945 Regard me as a blank slate. So far I have had only hearsay and hearsay has very little place in my life. Solid facts are what I want. Without a full knowledge of facts I shall be able to do little to help you. It is not that you have nothing to say. That would mean that the institution is perfect. But nothing in this world is perfect. Speak to me freely about the shortcomings. Good things speak for themselves, not the bad things, at any rate, not to me. I have followed every word of what you have said with the keenest interest and I have learned a lot from it. I do not propose to make detailed observations on what has been said or to give expression to all that is welling up in me just now but shall confine myself to one or two remarks of a general character. As I listened while Nanda Babu{2} and Kshiti mohan Babu were speaking, I said to myself: ‘Here is a real difficulty; but it is a diffi- culty of our own making.’ If a person conducts a big department he is expected to transmit what he stands for to someone who can be termed as his successor. Yet it is the dominant cry of the two stalwarts that they are unable to find a suitable successor for their respective departments. True, these are departments of a special character. I know these departments and I know too Gurudev’s views about them. Speaking generally, may I venture to suggest that there is no difficulty but can be overcome by tapascharya? It is almost an untranslatable word, the nearest approach to its true meaning being perhaps ‘single- minded devotion’. But it means much more than that. When-ever, in the course of my multifarious activities, I have been con-fronted with a difficulty of this character, this single-minded devotion has solved my difficulty in a manner which I had never expected. During my twenty long years in God-forsaken South Africa, where under cir- cumstances of the worst kind conceivable I found my God, it was my invariable experience that the right helper appeared at the right moment. It is my conviction, which I arrived at after a long and laborious struggle, that Gurudev as a person was much superior to his works or even this institution where he soared and sang. He poured his whole soul into it and nurtured it with his life’s blood and yet I dare say that his greatness was not fully expressed by it or through it. That is perhaps true of all great and good men—they are better and greater than their works. If, then, you are to represent that goodness or great- ness for which Gurudev stands but which he could not express fully even through this institution, you can do it only through tapas- charya. There is a remarkable string of verses in the Tulsi Ramayana to the effect that what is not possible through other means becomes possible through tapascharya. This is said with reference to Parvati. Narada had prophesied that she would have for her companion-in-life one who answered to the description of Siva. If instead of Siva those characteristics were met in the person of a rogue, her life would be ruined. How to avert such a calamity was the problem and it is in that context that the verses to which I have referred come. I commend these verses to you for your careful perusal. Only you will have to strip them of their orthodoxy. Finances were mentioned by you in the course of discussion. I will plead with you to dismiss from your thoughts the word ‘finance’ altogether. I am convinced that lack of finances never represented a real difficulty to a sincere worker. Finances follow—they dog your footsteps if you represent a real cause. Here, let me utter a warning. A worker may be real and yet the cause he represents may not be real. His handicap in that case will continue. There are, of course, seeming exceptions. The world is full of fools and successful rogues. But speaking of sincere men and women, it is my faith that if their cause is as worthy as their means, the handicap of finance need never deter them or damp their ardour. It is a big thing you have undertaken and in future you may have to undertake still bigger things and the question will be raised, ‘What about the finances ?’ and you will find that the difficulty lies somewhere else rather than in the lack of finances. Set it right and the finances will take care of themselves. Yours{3} is a common difficulty. You cannot ride two horses at the same time. If you mix day-scholars with full-time students, the former will overshadow and spoil the training of the latter. Your ins- titution was not designed for the mixture. Then it was said by Krishna Kripalani that they did not know what they were aiming at or stood for, what the sum total of the energies of Santiniketan and Sriniketan signified. My answer is that the ideal before you is not to represent Bengal or even India; you have to represent the whole world. Gurudev’s claim was not smaller than that. He stood for humanity as a whole. He could not do that unless he represented India with its destitute, dumb millions. That should be your aspiration as well. Unless you represent that mass mind of India you will not represent Gurudev as a man. You may represent him as a singer, as a painter, or as a great poet but you won’t represent him, and history will say of Gurudev that his institution was a failure. I do not want history to give that verdict. I agree that if my claim that I am one of you is to be fully vindicated I ought to be here in your midst for a longer time.{4} I would love to do so. But my future dispositions are in the hands of God.",

      "fullContent": ". DISCUSSION WITH STUDENTS{1} Gandhiji explained to them how almost since the beginning of his public life in South Africa he had been closely associated with labour. When he settled down to practise at the bar in South Africa he decided to give the whole of his spare time to work for the Indian settlers there, and the first man who came to him for assistance was an indentured labourer. This case at once put him in touch with labour. The labourers brought to him their troubles with their employers and also their personal and domestic worries, and that gave him a glimpse into their lives as nothing else could have done. Non-violence was the first thing he placed before them, and non- violence was the only thing that they had been pledged to observe when, at a critical stage in the satyagraha campaign, nearly 60,000 labourers downed their tools and faced imprisonment. They went through untold hardships, suffering, starvation, and some even died, but they adhered to non-violence until the end. Their condition was particularly difficult and in a sense worse than the workers’ here. They were not free, but indentured, and they had to fight not only for justice from their employers but for the abolition of the opprobrious £3 tax which threatened them with extinction. But non-violence helped them to pull through. His work in Champaran and Ahmedabad was recent history. Regarding Champaran he said that the condition of the peasants there was almost the same as the indentured labourers’, and that they had failed in their agitation for nearly half a century for there was no cohesive power of non- violence to hold them together. There had been several riots and their condition had grown worse every year. But the first taste of non-violence breathed new life into them, and at the end of a remarkably brief struggle they were emancipated. Without that necessary discipline in non-violence, they would have internecine strife and would never be ready to develop the strength that is needed to enable them to realize the power that they possess. Organization, technical skill and everything else would follow the acceptance of the fundamental principle of non- violence. Class collaboration would also follow as a matter of course. They are strong in numbers and yet they feel so dependent, so very much at the mercy of their employers. That is because they do not know their own inherent strength. Otherwise what is there to prevent them from pooling their own resources and dictating terms as employers do now. The thing that they have to realize is that labour is as much capital as metal. That realization can come only through acceptance of non- violence. But after that realization has come and they have come to their own, non-violence does not become superfluous. If they were to bid good-bye to it, they would be as bad as capitalists and turn exploiters themselves. The realizaton of their strength combined with adherence to non-violence would enable them to co-operate with capital and turn it to proper use. Then they will not regard it as a conflicting interest, they will not regard the mill and the machinery as belonging to the exploiting agents and grinding them down, but as their own instruments of production, and will therefore protect them as well as they would their own property. They will not steal time and turn out less work, but will put in the most they can. In fact, capital and labour will be mutual trustees and both will be trustees of consumers. The trusteeship theory is not unilateral and does not in the least imply superiority of the turstee. It is, as I have shown, a perfectly mutual affair, and each believes that his own interest is best safeguarded by safeguarding the interest of the other. ‘May you propitiate the gods and may the gods propitiate you, and may you reach the highest good by this mutual propitiation,’ says the Bhagavad Gita. There is no separate species called gods in the universe, but all who have the power of production and will work for the community using that power are gods—labourers no less than the capitalists.",

      "fullContent": "{1} She talked of her experience of the British slums and put in a strong plea for the “poor woman” who had to submit to the strong man. There is no poor woman. Poor woman is mightier than man, and I am quite prepared to demonstrate it to you if you come to the villages of India. Any woman there would tell you that, if she did not want it, there was no man born of woman who could compel her. I can say this from my own experience in relation to my wife, and mine is no solitary instance. If the will to die rather than to yield is there, no monster can make the woman yield. No, it is a mutual affair. Men and women both are a mixture of the brute and the divine, and if we can subdue the brute, it is well and good. But what is the woman to do, if the man for the sake of not having more children goes to another woman? So now you are shifting your own ground. If you misconceive your premises, you are bound to come to wrong conclusions. Don’t assume things and try to unman man and unwoman woman. Let me understand the basis of your gospel. When I said your birth-control propaganda was sufficient introduction, there was some seriousness behind the joke, for I know that there are some men and women who think that in birth control lies our salvation. Let me, therefore, understand the basis from you. I do not see in it the salvation of the world, but what I say is that without some form of birth-control there is no salvation. You would do it in one way, I would do it in another. I advocate your method as well, but not in all cases. You seem to regard a beautiful function as something objectionable. Two animals are nearest to the divine when they are going to create new life. There is something very beautiful in the act. Here again you are labouring under a confusion. The creation of a new life is nearest the divine, I agree. All I want is that one shouldapproach that act in a divine way. That is to say, man and woman must come together with no other desire than that of creating a new life. But if they come together merely to have a fond embrace, they are nearest the devil. Man unfortunately forgets that he is nearest the divine, hankers after the brute instinct in himself and becomes less than the brute. But why must you cast aspersion on the brute? I do not. The brute fulfils the law of his own nature. The lion in his majesty is a noble creature and he has a perfect right to eat me up, but I have none to develop paws and pounce upon you. Then I lower myself and become worse than the brute. I am sorry. I have expressed myself very badly. I confess that in a majority of cases it is not going to be their salvation, but a factor which will conduce to higher life. You understand what I mean, though I am afraid I have not been able to make myself quite clear. Oh, no. I do not want to take any undue advantage of you. But I want you to understand my view-point. Do not run away with misconceptions. Man must choose either of the two courses, the upward or the downward, but as he has the brute in him, he will more easily choose the downward course than the upward, especially when the downward course is presented to him in a beautiful garb. Man easily capitulates when sin is presented in the garb of virtue, and that is what Marie Stopes{2} and others are doing. If I were to popularize the religion of indulgence, I know that men would simply clutch at it. I know that, if people like you in selfless zeal cried themselves hoarse upholding your doctrine, you might even ride to apparent victory, but I also know that you will ride to certain death, of course totally unconscious of the mischief you are doing. The downward instinct requires no advocacy, no argument. It is there embodied in them, and unless you regulate and control it, there is danger of disease and pestilence. Mrs. Howe-Martyn, who until now seemed to accept the distinction between the divine and the devilish, contended that there was really none and that they were much more allied than people imagined. So you think the devil and the divine are the same? Do you believe in the sun? And if you do, don’t you think you must believe in the shadow? Why should you call ‘shadow’ devil? You may call it ‘no-God’, if you like. I do not think there is no-God in the shadow. There is life every- where. There is a thing like absence of life. Do you know that Hindus will reduce the body of the dearest one to ashes as soon as life in it is extinct? There is an essential unity in all life, but there is diversity, too, and one has to penetrate it and find the unity behind—but not by intellect, as you are trying to do. Where there is truth, there must be untruth; where there is light, there must be shadow. You cannot realize the wider consciousness, unless you subordinate completely reason and intellect, and the body, too. Mrs. Howe-Martyn looked puzzled, and time was fast running against her. But Gandhiji said: No. I am prepared to give you more time. But for that you must come to Wardha and stay with me. I am as great an enthusiast as you, and you must not leave India until you have converted me or converted yourself.",

      "fullContent": "A first class Deccan Sardar propounds the following conun- drums:{1} You say, on page 442 lines 4-6 of Harijan of 10th February,{2} that you put Europeans on the same footings as big zamindars and capitalists. I presume that you include in the general word ‘zamindars’, inamdars{3} , talukdars and big landholders. 1. Will you be pleased to say whether you remember and realise the fact that Europeans are foreigners and their earnings and profits go out of the country to enrich other nations and make them more powerful instruments to exploit India; while zamindars and inamdars. . . are Indian. . . and all their earnings and savings and even their extravagance will remain in this country. . . Many of these people have national interest fully at heart. . . 2. What are the differences between a nationalist zamindar and a nationalist non-zamindar, in your opinion? 3. What exact position do you assign to zamindars and inamdars, and the capitalists in a free and independent India? . . . 4. Have the zamindars and inamdars and capitalists any place in the present Congress, consistent with their limitations and commitments? Answers: 1. I make no difference between Europeans and Indians, if the former conform to the laws of free India. I cannot, consistently with my views on non-violence. Under my scheme European settlers will not be allowed to exploit the country as most of them are doing today. Patriots will have had their reward in the shape of freedom of their country. They are no patriots who are working with selfish personal ends in view. If we create a State based on pure justice, real equality and genuine brotherhood, Europeans will cease to be foreig- ners. They will take pride in pooling their talents for the sole good of the country of their adoption. I gladly acknowledge the fact that there are many inamdars, zamindars and other capitalists who are as patriotic as any Congress- men. 2. A nationalist zamindar will try to live like a non-zamindar. He will regard his tenants as his co-proprietors; in other words, he will hold his zamindari in trust for his tenants taking a moderate commission for the use of his labours and capital. A nationalist non- zamindar will not regard the zamindaras his natural enemy but will seek redress of his wrongs by the process of conversion. I have shown before now that this is not a long-drawn-out agony. 3. This is answered in the foregoing. Antagonism between the classes will be removed. I do not envisage a dead and artificial level among the people. There will be a variety among them as there is among the leaves of a tree. There will certainly be no have-note, no unemployment, and no disparity between classes and masses such as we see today. I have no doubt whatsoever that if non-violence in its full measure becomes the policy of the State, we shall reach essential equality without strife. 4. All who subscribe to the simple creed of the Congress can join it. As a matter of fact there are many moneyed members of the Congress. To quote only one instance, Jamnalalji is a capitalist and he is a member of the Working Committee. SEVAGRAM, April 22, 1940",

      "fullContent": "1 April 30, 1933 For some time now, I have been vacillating between twentyone days and forty days. After all, does one express, can one express, all one’s thoughts to others? Three days have passed since I lost my sleep. Could it be that I cannot sleep? But, for the last three days I have not been getting any sleep for hours at a stretch; I might get up at two in the morning and start work but not once would I doze while I dictated in the morning, nor even would I want to stretch my limbs, as if for the last three days I were preparing myself for the great deluge! It is difficult to say since when the excitement started. On many occasions, however, thought of a fast would repeatedly come to my mind and I would drive it away. In the night when I retired I had no idea that something was coming up today. But after eleven I woke up, I watched the stars, repeated Ramanama but the same thought would persistently come to my mind: ‘If you have grown so restless, why don’t you undertake the fast? Do it.’ The inner dialogue went on for quite some time. At half past twelve came the clear, unmistakable voice: ‘You must undertake the fast.’ That was all. Now having resolved to make it a twenty-one days’ fast, I took no time in deciding that as a prisoner I should undertake it after eight days’ . Without it the task of Harijan service is just impossible. If I don’t do this much the rot in Harijan work will reach the heart and destroy it altogether. I, therefore, got up and immediately began to write out the statement{1} and I, had just finished the last sentence when you came up for the prayers. Harijanbandhu, 7-5-1933",

      "fullContent": "{1} {2} Gandhiji opened the discussion by claiming himself to be a friend of the missionaries, ever since his close contact with them in South Africa. Though I have been a friend, I have always been a critic, not from any desire to be critical, but because I have felt that I would be a better friend if I opened out my heart, even at the risk of wounding their feelings. They never allowed me to think that they felt hurt, they certainly never resented my criticism. Then he referred to his first speech before the missionaries in India on swadeshi, since which twelve years had rolled away and with them much of the mists also. The first distinction I would like to make, after these prefatory remarks, between your missionary work and mine, is that while I am strengthening the faith of the people, you are undermining it. Your work, I have always held, will be all the richer, if you accept as settled facts the faiths of the people you come to serve—faiths which, however crude, are valuable to them. And in order to appreciate what I say, it becomes perhaps necessary to re-read the message of the Bible in terms of what is happening around us. The world is the same, but the spirit ever broadens intensively and extensively, and it might be that many things in the Bible will have to be re-interpreted in the light of discoveries—not of modern science—but in the spiritual world in the shape of direct experiences common to all faiths. The fundamental verses of St. John do require to be re-read and re- interpreted. I have come to feel that like us human beings words have their evolution from stage to stage in the contents they hold. For instance the contents of the richest word—God—are not the same to every one of us. They will vary with the experience of each. They will mean one thing to the Santhal and another to his next door neighbour Ravindranath Tagore. The sanatani may reject my interpretation of God and Hinduism. But God Himself is a long-suffering God who puts up with any amount of abuse and misinterpretations. If we were to put the spiritual experiences together we would find a resultant which would answer the cravings of human nature. Christianity is 1,900 years old, Islam is 1,300 years old, who knows the possibility of either? I have not read the Vedas in the original, but have tried to assimilate their spirit and have not hesitated to say that though the Vedas may be 13,000 years old—or even a million years old, as they well may be, for the word of God is as old as God Himself—even the Vedas must be interpreted in the light of our experience. The powers of God should not be limited by the limitations of our understanding. To you who have come to teach India, I therefore say, you cannot give without taking. If you have come to give rich treasures of experiences, open your hearts out to receive the treasures of this land, and you will not be disappointed, neither will you have misread the message of the Bible. Interesting questions and answers followed, which I summarize below : Q.What then are we doing? Are we doing the right thing? A. You are trying to do the right thing in the wrong way. I want you to complement the faith of the people instead of undermining it. As the Dewan of Mysore said in his address to the Assembly, the Adi Karnatakas should be made better Hindus, as they belong to Hindusim. I would similarly say to you, make us better Hindus, i.e., better men or women. Why should a man, even if he becomes a Christian, be torn from his surroundings? Whilst a boy I heard it being said, that to become a Christian was to have a brandy bottle in one hand and beef in the other. Things are better now, but it is not unusual to find Christianity synonymous with denationalization and Europeanization. Must we give up our simplicity, to become better people? Do not lay the axe at our simplicity. There are not only two issues before us, viz., to serve and to teach, there is a third issue, viz., evangelizing, declaring the glad tidings of the coming of Jesus and his death in redemption for our sins. What is the right way of giving the good news? We need not undermine the faith but we may make people lose their faith in lesser things. That lands me into the region of interpretation. Whilst I must not enter into it. I may suggest that God did not bear the Cross only 1,900 years ago, but He bears it today, and He dies and is resurrected from day to day. It would be poor comfort to the world if it had to depend upon a historical God who died 2,000 years ago. Do not then preach the God of history, but show Him as He lives today through you. In South Africa I met a number of friends, and read a number of books—Pearson, Parker and Butlerall giving their own interpretations, and I said to myself I must not bother myself with these conflicting interpretations. It is better to allow our lives to speak for us than our words. C.F. Andrews never preaches. He is incessantly doing his work. He finds enough work and stays where he finds it and takes no credit for bearing the Cross. I have the honour to know hundreds of honest Christians, but I have not known one better than Andrews. But what about animistic beliefs? Should they not be corrected? Well, we have been working amongst the so-called ‘untouchables’ and backward classes, and we have never bothered ourselves with their beliefs, animistic or otherwise. Superstitions and undesirable things go as soon as we begin to live the correct life. I concern myself not with their belief but with asking them to do the right thing. As soon as they do it, their belief rights itself. You speak of simplicity. But what are we to do in this age of motor-cars? You could not have come here without a motor-car! Well, a motor-car is not a necessity. I certainly did not need it to come here. If God wants you to be useful he should find the means to make you useful. Motor-cars do not mean the sum of our spiritual experience. There was no motor-car in Jesus’ or Mahomed’s time, and yet they did not need them for their work. I do not hold them to be essential for real progress. We need to be humble. And humility and simplicity are not mere outward expressions. When Paul speaks of humility he means heart-humility. A true Christian has little need to speak. He goes about his Father’s business. May I cite my own case? Speeches were the least part of my work in South Africa. Most of the 16,000 people who rose like one man and joined me had not even seen me, much less heard me speak. How can we help condemning if we feel that our Christian truth is the only reality? That brings me to the duty of tolerance. If you cannot feel that the other faith is as true as yours, you should feel at least that the men are as true as you. The intolerance of the Christian missionaries does not, I am glad to say, take the ugly shape it used to take some years ago. Think of the caricature of Hinduism, which one finds in so many publications of the Christian Literature Society. A lady wrote to me the other day saying that unless I embraced Christianity all my work would be nothing worth. And of course that Christianity must mean what she understands as such! Well, all I can say is that it is a wrong attitude.",
